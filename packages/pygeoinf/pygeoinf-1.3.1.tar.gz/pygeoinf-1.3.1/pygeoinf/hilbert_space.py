"""
Defines the foundational abstractions for working with Hilbert spaces.

This module provides the core `HilbertSpace` abstract base class (ABC), which
serves as a mathematical abstraction for real vector spaces equipped with an
inner product. The design separates abstract vector operations from their
concrete representations (e.g., as NumPy arrays), allowing for generic and
reusable implementations of linear operators and algorithms.

The inner product of a space is defined by its Riesz representation map
(`to_dual` and `from_dual` methods), which connects the space to its dual.
Concrete subclasses must implement the abstract methods to define a specific
type of space.

Key Classes
-----------
- `HilbertSpace`: The primary ABC defining the interface for all Hilbert spaces.
- `DualHilbertSpace`: A wrapper class representing the dual of a Hilbert space.
- `HilbertModule`: An ABC for Hilbert spaces that also support vector multiplication.
- `EuclideanSpace`: A concrete implementation for R^n using NumPy arrays.
- `MassWeightedHilbertSpace`: A space whose inner product is weighted by a
  mass operator relative to an underlying space.
