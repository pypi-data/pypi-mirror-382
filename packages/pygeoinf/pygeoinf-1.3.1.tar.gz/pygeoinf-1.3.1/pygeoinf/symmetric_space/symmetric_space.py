"""
Provides an abstract framework for function spaces on symmetric manifolds.

This module offers a powerful abstract framework for defining Hilbert spaces of
functions on symmetric spaces (like spheres or tori). The core design
leverages the spectral properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Δ), which
is fundamental to the geometry of these spaces.

By inheriting from these base classes and implementing a few key abstract
methods (like the Laplacian eigenvalues), a concrete class can automatically
gain a rich set of tools for defining invariant operators and probability
measures. This is a cornerstone of fields like spatial statistics and
geometric machine learning.

Key Classes
-----------
AbstractInvariantLebesgueSpace
    An abstract base class for L²-type spaces. It provides methods to construct
    operators that are functions of the Laplacian (`f(Δ)`) and to build
    statistically isotropic (rotationally-invariant) Gaussian measures.

AbstractInvariantSobolevSpace
    An abstract base class for Sobolev spaces (Hˢ). It extends the Lebesgue
    functionality with features that require higher smoothness, most notably
    point evaluation via Dirac delta functionals, which is essential for

    connecting the abstract function space to discrete data points.
