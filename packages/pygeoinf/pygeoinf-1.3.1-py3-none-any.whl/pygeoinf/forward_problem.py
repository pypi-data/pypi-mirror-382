"""
Defines the mathematical structure of a forward problem.

This module provides classes that encapsulate the core components of an
inverse problem. A forward problem describes the physical or mathematical
process that maps a set of unknown model parameters `u` to a set of observable
data `d`.

The module handles both the deterministic relationship `d = A(u)` and the more
realistic statistical model `d = A(u) + e`, where `e` represents random noise.

Key Classes
-----------
- `ForwardProblem`: A general class representing the link between a model
  space and a data space via a forward operator, with an optional data error.
- `LinearForwardProblem`: A specialization for linear problems where the
  forward operator is a `LinearOperator`.
