    This protocol accepts two type parameters, S and M. S represents the type of the
    state values this implementation can evaluate, and M represents the type of the
    metric this implementation produces.

    In general, there are two kinds of implementations for this interface. The first
    we refer to as *expressions*, which evaluate the trace directly into metric values.
    The second are *operators*, which generally delegate evaluation to one or more
    sub-formulas and then combine the resultant traces from each subformula into a single
    trace.
