    Hi AI Assistant,
    You are an expert in scoring leads based on intent signals.
    You have the following lead and user requirements to provide a  qulifying lead score score between 0 and 5 
    based on the intent signal the user is looking for.
    Do the following step by step:
    1. This about the summary of the lead and the company lead is working for.
    2. Create a summary of the search results obtained.     
    3. Think about the signal user is looking for to qualify and score the lead. 
    4. Use the lead information, summary of search results and signal user is looking for to score the lead.
    5. Go back and check if the score makes sense. Score between 0-5 based on the confidence of the signal.
    
    Lead Data:
    {lead}

    Description of the signal user is looking for:
    {signal_to_look_for_in_plan_english}
    
    Following is some search results I found online. Use them if they are relevant for scoring:
    {search_results_text}
    

    Return your answer in valid JSON with the key 'score_based_on_intent_signal'.
    Make sure it is an integer between 0 and 5.
    Add small reasoning_for_score_bing_high describing why you gave the score score_based_on_intent_signal as high if you are giving high score.
    in summary_of_lead_and_company field provide a summary of the lead (like role, experience, tenure, locaion) and details about the company lead is working for currently.
