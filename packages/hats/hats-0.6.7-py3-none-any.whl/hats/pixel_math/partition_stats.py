    We may initially find healpix pixels at order 10, but after aggregating up to the pixel

    at order 10 to their destination pixel. This may be used as an input into later partitioning

            constrains the partitioning to prevent spatially large pixels.

    Checks from higher order (smaller areas) out to lower order (large areas). In this way, we are able to

    This method can be slower than the above `_get_alignment` method, and so should only be used

    This uses a form of hiearchical agglomeration (building a tree bottom-up). For each cell
    at order n, we look at the counts in all 4 subcells at order (n+1). We have two numeric
    values that are easy to compute that we can refer to easily:

    - quad_sum: the total number of counts in this cell
    - quad_max: the largest count within the 4 subcells

    Our agglomeration criteria (the conditions under which we collapse) must BOTH be met:

    - total number in cell is less than the global threshold (quad_sum <= threshold)
    - more than one subcell contains values (quad_sum != quad_max) (if exactly 1
      subcell contains counts, then all of the quad_sum will come from that single quad_max)

    - total number in cell is greater than the threshold
