dimensions.py - Rendering Dimension Calculation

This module provides the single source of truth for calculating the correct
rendering dimensions for any media file to fit within the terminal while
preserving its aspect ratio. It accounts for the non-square nature of terminal
character cells to prevent visual distortion.
