## 1. Installation

Install `spikee` directly from PyPI.

```bash
pip install spikee
```

To ensure a clean installation when upgrading, use the `--force-reinstall` flag (*this helps a lot removing deprecated files/datasets that would otherwise persist*):
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall spikee
```

### 1.2 Local Installation (From Source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReversecLabs/spikee.git
cd spikee
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install .
```

### 1.3 Local Inference Dependencies

For targets requiring local model inference:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-local-inference.txt
```

---

## 2. Core Workflow: A Practical Guide

### Step 1: Initialize a Workspace

Create a project directory and initialize it. This sets up the folder structure and dataset files.

```bash
mkdir my-spikee-project
cd my-spikee-project
spikee init
```

### Step 2: Explore Available Components

Use `spikee list` to see what seeds, targets, plugins, and attacks are available in your workspace (both local and built-in).

```bash
spikee list seeds 
spikee list plugins
spikee list judges     
spikee list datasets     
spikee list targets    
spikee list attacks    
```

### Step 3: Choose a Scenario and Generate a Dataset

Your testing scenario determines what kind of testing dataset you need to generate.

#### Scenario A: Testing a Standalone LLM
When you test an LLM directly, you control the entire prompt. This is ideal for assessing a model's general resilience to jailbreaks and harmful instructions.

*   **What to Generate:** A *full prompt*, which includes a task (like "Summarize this: <data>"), the data containing the prompt injection or jailbreak, and optionally a system message.
*   **How to Generate:** Use `--format full-prompt` and optionally `--include-system-message`. The `datasets/seeds-cybersec-2025-04` folder provides a great starting point with diverse jailbreaks and attack instructions.

```bash
spikee generate --seed-folder datasets/seeds-cybersec-2025-04 --format full-prompt
```

This will generate the dataset in JSONL format: `datasets/cybersec-2025-04-full-prompt-dataset-TIMESTAMP.jsonl`.

#### Scenario B: Testing an LLM Application 
When you test an application (like a chatbot or an email summarizer), the application itself builds the final prompt. Your input is just one part of it, which could be a prompt or data (such as documents/emails).

*   **What to Generate:** Just the *user prompt* or *document* with the attack payload (e.g., the body of an email containing a prompt injection).
*   **How to Generate:** Use `--format user-input` (you can omit as this is the default from v0.4.1).

```bash
spikee generate --seed-folder datasets/seeds-cybersec-2025-04 --format user-input
```

This will generate the dataset in JSONL format: `datasets/cybersec-2025-04-document-dataset-TIMESTAMP.jsonl`.

#### Bonus: Including standalone attacks
The `generate` command we saw before composes a dataset by combining documents with jailbreaks and instructions. However, some datasets - such as `seeds-simsonsun-high-quality-jailbreaks` and `in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts` - contain a static list of ready-to-use attack prompts. To include those in the generated dataset, we use `--include-standalone-inputs`:

```bash
spikee generate --seed-folder datasets/seeds-simsonsun-high-quality-jailbreaks \
                --include-standalone-inputs \
```


### Step 4: Test a Target

`spikee test` runs your dataset against a target. First, rename `.env-example` to `.env` and add any necessary API keys.

#### A. Basic LLM Test
This command tests gpt-4o-mini via the OpenAI API using the dataset generated in Scenario A (require `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`).

```bash
spikee test --dataset datasets/cybersec-2025-04-full-prompt-dataset-*.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --target-options gpt-4o-mini
```

> **How is attack success determined? With Judges.**
>
> The `cybersec-2025-04` dataset contains attacks whose success can be verified automatically by searching for specific "canary" words or matching regular expressions in the response (such as the presence of a *Markdown image*).
>
> For more complex goals, like checking for harmful content or policy violations, Spikee can use more complex **Judges**. These are Python modules that evaluate the target's response. We include simple LLM-based judges that can assess if a response meets a given criteria. See the **[Judges documentation](./docs/06_judges.md)** to learn more.

#### B. Testing a Custom LLM Application
To test an LLM application, you must create a custom **Target script**. This Python script, placed in the `targets/` directory in your workspace, tells Spikee how to send data to the application and receive its response. For details, see the **[Creating Custom Targets](./docs/03_custom_targets.md)** guide.

```bash
# Test a custom email application using malicious documents and your custom target
spikee test --dataset datasets/llm-mailbox-document-dataset-*.jsonl \
            --target llm_mailbox
```

> Especially when testing LLM applications, it's useful to create a custom dataset tailored to the specific use case. In the sample case of the LLM Webmail application, we create a custom dataset stating from `cybersec-2025-04`, that only focusses on testing exfiltration of confidential information via mardown images. Check this tutorial for more information: https://labs.reversec.com/posts/2025/01/spikee-testing-llm-applications-for-prompt-injection

#### C. Resume Options

Spikee can resume interrupted runs:

- `--resume-file <file>`  
  Resume explicitly from the given results file.

- `--auto-resume`  
  * Non-TTY (scripts/CI): automatically resume from the latest matching results file without prompting.  
  * TTY (interactive): same as default (you will be prompted).

- `--no-auto-resume`  
  Disable the interactive resume prompt in TTY mode.

**Default behavior**  
- In interactive TTY: Spikee searches for matching results files and prompts you to resume.  
- In non-TTY: Spikee does not auto-resume unless `--auto-resume` is set.

#### D. Enhancing Tests with Attacks
If static prompts fail, use `--attack` to run iterative scripts that modifies the prompt/documents until they succeed (or run out of iterations).

```bash
# Best of N attack
spikee test --dataset datasets/dataset-name.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --attack best_of_n --attack-iterations 25
```

```bash
# Anti spotlighting attack
spikee test --dataset datasets/dataset-name.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --attack anti_spotlighting --attack-iterations 50
```

Some attacks, like `prompt decompositoion` support options, such as whih LLM to use to generate attack prompt variations:
```bash
spikee test --dataset datasets/dataset-name.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --attack prompt_decomposition --attack-iterations 50 -attack-options 'mode=ollama-llama3.2'
```

#### E. Testing a Sample of a Large Dataset
For large datasets, or when operating under time and cost constraints, you can test a random subset of the dataset using the `--sample` flag.

By default, Spikee uses a static seed for sampling. This means that running the same command multiple times will always select the **same random sample**, ensuring your tests are reproducible. This is useful for regression testing.

```bash
# Test a reproducible 15% sample of a large dataset.
# This will select the same 15% of entries every time you run it.
spikee test --dataset datasets/large-dataset.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --sample 0.15
```

If you need a different sample for each run, or want to use your own seed for reproducibility across different machines or setups, you can use the `--sample-seed` flag.

```bash
# Use a custom seed for a different reproducible sample
spikee test --dataset datasets/large-dataset.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --sample 0.1 \
            --sample-seed 123

# Use a truly random sample on each run
spikee test --dataset datasets/large-dataset.jsonl \
            --target openai_api \
            --sample 0.1 \
            --sample-seed random
```

#### F. Evaluating Guardrails
When you're testing an LLM application, you're automatically testing any guardrail that the developers of the application have applied. Howeer, sometimes you might want to test individual guardrails in isolation.

**1. Testing a Prompt Injection Guardrail:**
To test a guardrail's ability to block general jailbreaks, you could use a broad dataset like `in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts`, or a more high-quality, focussed one like `seeds-simsonsun-high-quality-jailbreaks`.

```bash
# Test Meta's Prompt Guard against jailbreaks
spikee generate --seed-folder datasets/seeds-simsonsun-high-quality-jailbreaks \
                --include-standalone-inputs \

spikee test --dataset datasets/simsonsun-high-quality-jailbreaks-*.jsonl \
            --target prompt_guard_jailbreak
```

The output of this will tell you whether a particular prompt in the dataset bypassed the guardrial. *This doesn't mean the jailbreak would succeed against an LLM, but simply that it would not be blocked by a guardrail*.

**2. Testing a Topical Guardrail:**
To test a guardrail that blocks specific topics (like financial advice), use a purpose-built dataset, like the sample one that can be generated from these seeds: `seeds-investment-advice`.

```bash
spikee generate --seed-folder datasets/seeds-investment-advice \
                --include-standalone-inputs \
                --include-system-message \
```

Notice that here we use `--format document`, as we just want to generate the raw prompts/queries from the seed folder, we don't want to add additional prompts. Also notice that we use `--include-system-message`, as the topical guardrail will use this to determine whether the input aligns wit hthe system_message rules.

```bash
spikee test --dataset datasets/investment-advice-document-sys-dataset-TIMESTAMP.jsonl \
            --target nvidia_nemoguard_topic_control
```

### Step 5: Analyze the Results

Use `spikee results analyze` to get a statistical summary of the test run.

```bash
# Analyze the most recent results file for the openai_api target
spikee results analyze --result-file results/results_openai_api-gpt-4o-mini_*.jsonl
```
This command provides an overview of the success rate and detailed breakdowns by attack type, helping you identify specific weaknesses.
