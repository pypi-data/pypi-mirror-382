## 🚀 Installation

You can install mistercar-input-devices using pip:

```bash
pip install mistercar-input-devices
```

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher

#### Windows gamepad support setup

The following steps are only necessary if you plan to use gamepad features on Windows:

1. Disable driver signature enforcement. This is necessary for installing unsigned drivers. Follow the instructions in this guide: [How to disable driver signature enforcement on Windows 10](https://medium.com/@pypaya_tech/unlock-your-windows-a-guide-to-disabling-driver-signature-enforcement-342103d51997)

2. Open a command prompt as an administrator.

3. Navigate to the appropriate directory:
   - For 64-bit systems: `cd path\to\mistercar_input_devices\backend\windows\platform_specific\pyxinput\ScpVBus-x64`
   - For 32-bit systems: `cd path\to\mistercar_input_devices\backend\windows\platform_specific\pyxinput\ScpVBus-x86`

4. Run the following command:
   ```
   devcon.exe install ScpVBus.inf Root\ScpVBus
   ```

if global_keyboard_reader.get_key_state('A'):
    print("A key is pressed")

# Press a key
global_keyboard_emulator.emulate_key('B', 1)  # Press
global_keyboard_emulator.emulate_key('B', 0)  # Release
```

### 🖱️ Mouse

```python
from mistercar_input_devices.input_readers.mouse_reader import global_mouse_reader
from mistercar_input_devices.input_emulators.mouse_emulator import global_mouse_emulator

# Read mouse position
x, y = global_mouse_reader.get_cursor_position()
print(f"Mouse position: {x}, {y}")

# Move mouse
global_mouse_emulator.move_cursor_to(100, 100)

# Click
global_mouse_emulator.left_click()
```

### 🕹️ Gamepad

```python
from mistercar_input_devices.input_readers.gamepad_reader import global_gamepad_reader
from mistercar_input_devices.input_emulators.gamepad_emulator import global_gamepad_emulator

# Read gamepad sticks
left_stick = global_gamepad_reader.get_left_stick()
print(f"Left stick: {left_stick}")  # Returns (x, y) tuple

# Read individual stick axes
left_x = global_gamepad_reader.get_left_stick_x()
print(f"Left stick X-axis: {left_x}")

# Read triggers
triggers = global_gamepad_reader.get_triggers()
print(f"Triggers (left, right): {triggers}")

# Read face buttons
face_buttons = global_gamepad_reader.get_face_buttons()
print(f"Face buttons [A, B, X, Y]: {face_buttons}")

# Read individual buttons
if global_gamepad_reader.get_button_a():
    print("A button is pressed")

# Emulate gamepad input
global_gamepad_emulator.emulate_left_stick(0.5, -0.3)  # Move left stick
global_gamepad_emulator.emulate_left_trigger(0.8)      # Press left trigger
global_gamepad_emulator.emulate_button_a(True)         # Press A button
global_gamepad_emulator.emulate_button_a(False)        # Release A button
```

### 🏎️ Racing Wheel

```python
from mistercar_input_devices.input_readers.wheel_reader.manufacturers.thrustmaster.tmx import (
    global_tmx_wheel, WheelButton
)

# Get complete wheel state
state = global_tmx_wheel.get_state()
print(f"Steering: {state.steering:.2f}")  # -1.0 (full left) to 1.0 (full right)
print(f"Throttle: {state.throttle:.2f}")  # 0.0 to 1.0
print(f"Brake: {state.brake:.2f}")        # 0.0 to 1.0
print(f"Clutch: {state.clutch:.2f}")      # 0.0 to 1.0

# Check specific buttons
if state.buttons[WheelButton.XBOX_A]:
    print("A button is pressed")

if state.buttons[WheelButton.PADDLE_RIGHT]:
    print("Right paddle shifter is pressed")

# Switch pedal mode if needed (for wheels that support it)
global_tmx_wheel.set_pedal_mode("swapped")  # Changes throttle/clutch mapping
```
