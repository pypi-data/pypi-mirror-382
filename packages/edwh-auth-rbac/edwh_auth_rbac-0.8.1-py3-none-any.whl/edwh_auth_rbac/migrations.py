"""
Functions for managing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) database tables and views.

This module includes functions to define and manage the database schema
for tables and views used in Role-Based Access Control, such as creating
tables for identity, membership, and permission, as well as views for
recursive relationships.

Functions:
- rbac_tables: Creates the RBAC-related tables in the database.
- rbac_views: Creates the RBAC-related recursive views in the database.
