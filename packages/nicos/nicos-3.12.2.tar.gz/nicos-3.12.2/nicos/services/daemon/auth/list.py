    """Authenticates against the fixed list of usernames, passwords and
    user levels given in the "passwd" parameter (in order).

    An empty password means that any password is accepted.
    An empty username means that any username is accepted.
    Passwordless entries and anonymous entries are restricted
    to 'at most' USER level. If both fields are unspecified, we still request
    a username and restrict to GUEST level.

    One way to create the password hashes is the use of the `mkpasswd` tool::

      # tools/mkpasswd -E md5
      Please enter password:
      5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

    or::

      # tools/mkpasswd -E sha1
      Please enter password:
      5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8

    These hexdigests can be used in the `passwd` list::

       passwd = [
           ...
           ('username', '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99', 'user'),
