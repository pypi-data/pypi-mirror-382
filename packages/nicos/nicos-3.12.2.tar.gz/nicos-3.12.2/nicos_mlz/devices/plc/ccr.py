    Deriving from AnalogInput as this already handles the unit.
    AnalogOutput has HasLimits mixin is therefore too complex.
    Could also inherit from PyTangoDevice instead of AnalogInput,
    but would need to duplicate unit handling.

    In the future this may use the pressure sensor as attached_device
    and use the tango_device of the sensor directly.
    Also in the future, the limits may be calculated from a Temperature.

    As long as none of the details of 'in the future we may...' is clear,
    we stick with a minimalist implementation allowing setting and
    reading the limits as an additional device (of this class).
