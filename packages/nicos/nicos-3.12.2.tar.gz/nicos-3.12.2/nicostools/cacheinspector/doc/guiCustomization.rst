Tool boxes
==========

There are two tool boxes one having client options (such as Connect, Disconnect,
or Quit) and the other one has options changing the current view. These tool
boxes can be dropped at any edge of the window. So the tool boxes can be put at
the top, left, right, or bottom of the window. As of now their position is not
saved which means restarting the program will reset the positioning. Both tool
boxes can also be put next to each other.

Cache Tree
==========

The Cache Tree can be resized. Resizing it to the smallest possible will make
the key-value view on the right side bigger. This is useful if the cache tree
isn't important right now and the keys are quite long. It also works the other
way around. Resizing the Cache Tree to the biggest possible will hide the
key-value view. Allowing to easily navigate through long and deep cache
structures if necessary.

The size of the Cache Tree and the key-value view is not saved either.
