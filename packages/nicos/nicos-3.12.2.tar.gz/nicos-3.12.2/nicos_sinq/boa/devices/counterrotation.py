"""Implementation of BOA counter rotating motors. BOA often has two rotation
tables installed on  a given component position, each with different bits
attached to it. Now the requirement is to move one of those motors, thereby
leaving the other pointing in the same direction:.i.e the second rotation
has to be moved in the other direction as the first motor by the same
amount. Doing this perfectly would require synchronisation in the motor
controller electronics. But the experience shows that doing this from the
top level is good enough. It helps that the participating motors are of the
same type and have the same speed."""
