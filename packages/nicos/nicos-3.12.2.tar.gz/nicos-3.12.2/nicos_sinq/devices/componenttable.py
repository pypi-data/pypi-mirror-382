    Some beamlines are very flexible in that various components,
    represented by setups, can be freely positioned on various
    stages of the instrument. When writing data files it is very
    useful to store the information which component and devices
    were on which stage. Storing this association: setups and
    devices to stages is the purpose of this class. Datasinks
    can then consult the ComponentTable class in order to store
    device data at the right place.

    Some stages have fixed devices associated with them. These are
    stored in the standard_devices parameter.
