Contributing to  NICOS
======================

Thanks for wanting to contribute to NICOS.

While we offer a mirror of the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlz-ictrl/nicos),
our primary repository is our [Gerrit Code Review server](
https://forge.frm2.tum.de/review/q/status:open+project:frm2/nicos/nicos).

We will discuss and accept pull requests for small changes on GitHub,
but for larger-scale changes we ask that you contact us to get access to
the [Gerrit Code Review](https://forge.frm2.tum.de/review/q/status:open+project:frm2/nicos/nicos)
system, where it is much easier for us to keep track of such work.


Coding style
------------

We use a [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) based style. You will find
more info in our [wiki](https://forge.frm2.tum.de/wiki/projects:nicos:codingstyle).
