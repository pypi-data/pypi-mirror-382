Virtual twins of MLZ instruments
================================

This facility tree contains "virtual twins" of MLZ instruments, which
work together with a Monte-Carlo simulation and try to give a realistic
feel for the handling and performance of the instrument.

The sources for the simulations are collected in a separate git repository:
