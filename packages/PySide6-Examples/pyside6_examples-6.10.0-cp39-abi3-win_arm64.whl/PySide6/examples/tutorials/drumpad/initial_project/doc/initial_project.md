# Drumpad example (Qt Design Studio) - Initial project

This example contains the initial [Qt Design Studio] project to be used as a starting point for the
[Qt Design Studio integration tutorial]. **It is not an executable project as is**, since it does
**not** contain the required Python code developed along the tutorial.

For more details, see the [Qt Design Studio integration tutorial].

To download the final project source code, visit {ref}`example_tutorials_drumpad_final_project`.
