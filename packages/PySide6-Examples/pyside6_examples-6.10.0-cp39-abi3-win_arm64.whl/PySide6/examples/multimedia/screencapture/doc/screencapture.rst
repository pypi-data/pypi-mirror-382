Screen Capture Example
======================

Screen Capture demonstrates how to capture a screen or window using
``QScreenCapture`` and ``QWindowCapture``. The example shows a list of screens
and windows and displays a live preview of the selected item using a
``QMediaCaptureSession`` and a ``QVideoWidget``. Capturing can be started and
stopped with a ``QPushButton``.

Application Structure
+++++++++++++++++++++

The example consists of three custom classes. The UI and all screen capture
functionality is implemented in the class ``ScreenCapturePreview``. The classes
``ScreenListModel`` and ``WindowListModel`` only serve as models behind the two
``QListView`` widgets. The main function creates a ``ScreenCapturePreview``
object, which in turn creates instances of ``QScreenCapture`` and
``QWindowCapture``, and a ``QMediaCaptureSession`` and ``QVideoWidget``, in
addition to all the UI widgets.

The screen and window models are populated with the return values of
``QGuiApplication.screens()`` and ``QWindowCapture.capturableWindows()``,
respectively.

When a list item is selected, it is connected to the ``QScreenCapture`` object
with ``QScreenCapture.setScreen()``, or to the ``QWindowCapture`` object with
``QWindowCapture.setWindow().`` The capture object is connected to the
``QMediaCaptureSession`` object with
``QMediaCaptureSession.setScreenCapture()`` and
``QMediaCaptureSession.setWindowCapture()``, respectively. The capture session
in turn is connected to the ``QVideoWidget`` object with
``QMediaCaptureSession.setVideoOutput()``. Thus, the capture output is
previewed in the video widget on the right hand side of the UI.

The start/stop button calls ``QScreenCapture.start()`` and ``QScreenCapture.stop()``,
or ``QWindowCapture.start()`` and ``QWindowCapture.stop()``.

A QMessageBox pops up if an ``errorOccurred`` signal is emitted.
