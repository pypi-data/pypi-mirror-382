``AbstractViewer`` provides a generalized API to view, save, and print a
document. Properties of both the document and the viewer can be queried:

 * Does the document have content?
 * Has it been modified?
 * Is an overview (thumbnails or bookmarks) supported?

``AbstractViewer`` provides protected methods for derived classes to create
actions and menus on the main window. In order to display these assets on the
main window, they are parented to it. ``AbstractViewer`` is responsible for
removing and destroying the UI assets it creates. It inherits from ``QObject``
to implement signals and slots.

The ``uiInitialized()`` signal is emitted after a viewer receives all necessary
information about UI assets on the main window.

The ``printingEnabledChanged()`` signal is emitted when document printing is
either enabled or disabled. This happens after a new document was successfully
loaded, or, for example, all content was removed.

The ``printStatusChanged`` signal notifies about changes in its progress after
starting the printing process.

The ``documentLoaded()`` signal notifies the application that a document was
successfully loaded.
