The ``MainWindow`` class provides an application screen with menus, actions,
and a toolbar. It can open a file, automatically detecting its content type. It
also maintains a list of previously opened files, using ``QSettings`` to store
and reload settings when launched. The ``MainWindow`` creates a suitable viewer
for the opened file, based on its content type, and provides support for
printing a document.

``MainWindow's`` constructor initializes the user interface created in Qt
Designer. The ``mainwindow.ui`` file provides a ``QTabWidget`` on the left,
showing bookmarks and thumbnails. On the right, there is a ``QScrollArea`` for
viewing file content.
