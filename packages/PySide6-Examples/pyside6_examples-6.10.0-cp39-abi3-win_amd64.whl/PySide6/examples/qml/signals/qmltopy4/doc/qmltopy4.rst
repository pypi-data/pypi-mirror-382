Directly Connecting QML Component Signals to Python Functions
=============================================================

Teach how to connect signals of specific QML components to Python functions using object names.

**Key Features:**

- **Assigning `objectName` in QML:** Sets `objectName` properties to identify QML objects.
- **Finding QML Objects in Python:** Uses `findChild` to get references to QML objects.
- **Connecting Component Signals to Python Functions:** Connects signals directly to Python
  functions.
