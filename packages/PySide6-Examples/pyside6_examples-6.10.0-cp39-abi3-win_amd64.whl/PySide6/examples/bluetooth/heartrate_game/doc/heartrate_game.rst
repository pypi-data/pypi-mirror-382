====================================

.. tags:: Android

The Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Game shows how to develop a
Bluetooth Low Energy application using the Qt Bluetooth API. The
application covers the scanning for Bluetooth Low Energy devices,
connecting to a Heart Rate service on the device, writing
characteristics and descriptors, and receiving updates from the device
once the heart rate has changed.

The command line option `--simulator` can be used to run the example against a
demo server in case no Bluetooth hardware is available.
