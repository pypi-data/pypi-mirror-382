To create a statement you need to:

1.  Verify that you have enough permits. You need to belong to the *Show
    Full Accounting Features* group.
2.  Go to the menu: Invoicing -\> Reporting \> German Tax Statement
3.  Create a statement, providing a name and specifying start date and
    end date
4.  Press the Update button to calculate the report: the report lines
    will be displayed in the tab Statement
5.  Eventually you have to manually enter the tax base amounts of lines
    '20', '21', '22', '23', '24','26', '27', '28', '29', '30','32',
    '33', '34', '35', '36','38', '39', '40', '41', '42','48', '49',
    '50', '51', '52','64', '65', '67') if you want to change the values
    from float format to integer (in Edit mode, click on the amount of
    the line to be able to change the value).
6.  Press the Post button to set the status of the statement to Posted;
    the statements set to this state cannot be modified

To add past undeclared invoices:

1.  Open the tab Past Undeclared Invoices, available when the statement
    is in status Draft.
2.  Set an initial date (field From Date) from which the past undeclared
    invoices will be displayed.
3.  One by one, add the displayed undeclared invoices, by clicking on
    the Add Invoice button present in each line.
4.  Press the Update button in order to recompute the statement lines.

Extra info about the workflow:

1.  If you need to recalculate or modify or delete a statement already
    set to Posted status you need first to set it back to Draft status:
    press the button Reset to Draft
2.  Instead, if you send the statement to the Tax Authority, you may
    want to avoid that the statement is set back to Draft: to avoid
    this, press the button Final. If you then confirm, it will be not
    possible to modify this Statement or reset it back to draft anymore.

Printing a PDF report:

1.  If you need to print the report in PDF, open a statement form and
    click: Print -\> German Tax Statement
