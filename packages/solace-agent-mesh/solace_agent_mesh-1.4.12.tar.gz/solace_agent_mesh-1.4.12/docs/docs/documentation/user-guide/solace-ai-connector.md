# Solace AI Event Connector

The Solace AI Event Connector is an important part of Solace Agent Mesh. It is a powerful tool designed to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your event-driven architecture. It enables you to create efficient pipelines that can process events from the Solace event brokers, using AI and other types of components, and then publish the results back to the Solace event brokers.

## Key Features

- **Event Processing Pipeline**: Creates flows consisting of input components, processing components, and output components.
- **AI Model Integration**: Built on LangChain and LiteLLM supporting various AI models and providers.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Supports custom plugins and components for specialized processing needs.
- **Resilient Processing**: Ensures reliable event handling with acknowledgment-based processing.
- **Scalable Design**: Supports parallel processing and multiple component instances.

## How It Works

Solace AI Event Connector operates through a series of interconnected components:

1. **Flow Structure**

   - Each flow has one input component
   - Multiple processing components
   - One output component
   - Components are connected via queues for buffering

2. **Component Processing**

   - Each component runs in its own thread
   - Processes one message at a time
   - Supports input transforms and selections
   - Can be scaled with multiple instances for parallel processing

3. **Event Management**
   - Tracks events throughout the processing pipeline
   - Uses acknowledgment system for reliable delivery
   - Ensures no event loss during processing

## Configuration

The Solace AI Event Connector is configured through YAML files that allow you to:

- Define flow components and their sequence
- Set queue depths between components
- Configure the number of parallel instances
- Specify input/output parameters
- Define processing logic and transformations
- Pass the source path for the custom python components
