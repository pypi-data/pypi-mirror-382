- runas become - Fix up become logic to still get the SYSTEM token with the most privileges when running as SYSTEM.

v2.18.0
=======

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Stopped wrapping all commands sent over SSH on a Windows target with a ``powershell.exe`` executable. This results in one less process being started on each command for Windows to improve efficiency, simplify the code, and make ``raw`` an actual raw command run with the default shell configured on the Windows sshd settings. This should have no affect on most tasks except for ``raw`` which now is not guaranteed to always be running in a PowerShell shell and from having the console output codepage set to UTF-8. To avoid this issue either swap to using ``ansible.windows.win_command``, ``ansible.windows.win_shell``, ``ansible.windows.win_powershell`` or manually wrap the raw command with the shell commands needed to set the output console encoding.
- persistent connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Deprecate ``ansible.module_utils.basic.AnsibleModule.safe_eval`` and ``ansible.module_utils.common.safe_eval`` as they are no longer used.
- persistent connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect, and will be removed in a future release.
- yum_repository - deprecate ``async`` option as it has been removed in RHEL 8 and will be removed in ansible-core 2.22.
- yum_repository - the following options are deprecated: ``deltarpm_metadata_percentage``, ``gpgcakey``, ``http_caching``, ``keepalive``, ``metadata_expire_filter``, ``mirrorlist_expire``, ``protect``, ``ssl_check_cert_permissions``, ``ui_repoid_vars`` as they have no effect for dnf as an underlying package manager. The options will be removed in ansible-core 2.22.

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- Play - removed deprecated ``ROLE_CACHE`` property in favor of ``role_cache``.
- Remove deprecated `VariableManager._get_delegated_vars` method (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82950)
- Removed Python 3.10 as a supported version on the controller. Python 3.11 or newer is required.
- Removed support for setting the ``vars`` keyword to lists of dictionaries. It is now required to be a single dictionary.
- loader - remove deprecated non-inclusive words (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82947).
- paramiko_ssh - removed deprecated ssh_args from the paramiko_ssh connection plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82939).

- paramiko_ssh - removed deprecated ssh_extra_args from the paramiko_ssh connection plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82941).
- play_context - remove deprecated PlayContext.verbosity property (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82945).
- utils/listify - remove deprecated 'loader' argument from listify_lookup_plugin_terms API (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82949).

Security Fixes
--------------

- include_vars action - Ensure that result masking is correctly requested when vault-encrypted files are read. (CVE-2024-8775)
- task result processing - Ensure that action-sourced result masking (``_ansible_no_log=True``) is preserved. (CVE-2024-8775)
- user action won't allow ssh-keygen, chown and chmod to run on existing ssh public key file, avoiding traversal on existing symlinks (CVE-2024-9902).

Bugfixes
--------

- -> runas become - Generate new token for the SYSTEM token to use for become. This should result in the full SYSTEM token being used and problems starting the process that fails with ``The process creation has been blocked``.
- Add a version ceiling constraint for pypsrp to avoid potential breaking changes in the 1.0.0 release.
- Add descriptions for ``ansible-galaxy install --help` and ``ansible-galaxy role|collection install --help``.

- COLOR_SKIP will not alter "included" events color display anymore.
- Callbacks now correctly get the resolved connection plugin name as the connection used.
- Darwin - add unit tests for Darwin hardware fact gathering.

- Fix an issue where registered variable was not available for templating in ``loop_control.label`` on skipped looped tasks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83619)
- Fix disabling SSL verification when installing collections and roles from git repositories. If ``--ignore-certs`` isn't provided, the value for the ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` configuration option will be used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83326).
- Fix for ``meta`` tasks breaking host/fork affinity with ``host_pinned`` strategy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83294)
- Fix handlers not being executed in lockstep using the linear strategy in some cases (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82307)
- Fix rapid memory usage growth when notifying handlers using the ``listen`` keyword (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83392)
- Fix the task attribute ``resolved_action`` to show the FQCN instead of ``None`` when ``action`` or ``local_action`` is used in the playbook.
- Fix using ``module_defaults`` with ``local_action``/``action`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81905).
- Fix using the current task's directory for looking up relative paths within roles (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82695).
- Improve performance on large inventories by reducing the number of implicit meta tasks.
- Remove deprecated config options DEFAULT_FACT_PATH, DEFAULT_GATHER_SUBSET, and DEFAULT_GATHER_TIMEOUT in favor of setting ``fact_path``, ``gather_subset`` and ``gather_timeout`` as ``module_defaults`` for ``ansible.builtin.setup``.
  These will apply to both the ``gather_facts`` play keyword, and any ``ansible.builtin.setup`` tasks.
  To configure these options only for the ``gather_facts`` keyword, set these options as play keywords also.
- Set LANGUAGE environment variable is set to a non-English locale (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83608).
- Use the requested error message in the ansible.module_utils.facts.timeout timeout function instead of hardcoding one.
- ``ansible-galaxy install --help`` - Fix the usage text and document that the requirements file passed to ``-r`` can include collections and roles.
- ``ansible-galaxy role install`` - update the default timeout to download archive URLs from 20 seconds to 60 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83521).
- ``end_host`` - fix incorrect return code when executing ``end_host`` in the ``rescue`` section (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83447)
- ``package``/``dnf`` action plugins - provide the reason behind the failure to gather the ``ansible_pkg_mgr`` fact to identify the package backend
- addressed issue of trailing text been ignored, non-ASCII characters are parsed, enhance white space handling and fixed overly permissive issue of human_to_bytes filter(https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82075)
- ansible-config will now properly template defaults before dumping them.
- ansible-doc - fixed "inicates" typo in output
- ansible-doc - format top-level descriptions with multiple paragraphs as multiple paragraphs, instead of concatenating them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83155).
- ansible-doc - handle no_fail condition for role.
- ansible-doc - make colors configurable.
- ansible-galaxy collection install - remove old installation info when installing collections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83182).
- ansible-galaxy role install - fix symlinks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82702, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81965).
- ansible-test - Enable the ``sys.unraisablehook`` work-around for the ``pylint`` sanity test on Python 3.11. Previously the work-around was only enabled for Python 3.12 and later. However, the same issue has been discovered on Python 3.11.
- ansible-test - The ``pylint`` sanity test now includes the controller/target context of files when grouping them. This allows the ``--py-version`` option to be passed to ``pylint`` to indicate the minimum supported Python version for each test context, preventing ``pylint`` from defaulting to the Python version used to invoke the test.
- ansible-test action-plugin-docs - Fix to check for sidecar documentation for action plugins
- ansible_managed restored it's 'templatability' by ensuring the possible injection routes are cut off earlier in the process.
- apt - report changed=True when some packages are being removed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46314).
- apt_* - add more info messages raised while updating apt cache (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77941).
- assemble - update argument_spec with 'decrypt' option which is required by action plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80840).
- atomic_move - fix using the setgid bit on the parent directory when creating files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46742, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67177).
- config, restored the ability to set module compression via a variable
- connection plugins using the 'extras' option feature would need variables to match the plugin's loaded name, sometimes requiring fqcn, which is not the same as the documented/declared/expected variables. Now we fall back to the 'basename' of the fqcn, but plugin authors can still set the expected value directly.
- copy - mtime/atime not updated. Fix now update mtime/atime(https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83013)
- csvfile lookup - give an error when no search term is provided using modern config syntax (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83689).
- debconf - fix normalization of value representation for boolean vtypes in new packages (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83594)
- debconf - set empty password values (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83214).
- delay keyword is now a float, matching the underlying 'time' API and user expectations.
- display - warn user about empty log filepath (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79959).
- display now does a better job of mapping warnings/errors to the proper log severity when using ansible.log. We still use color as a fallback mapping (now prioritiezed by severity) but mostly rely on it beind directly set by warnning/errors calls.
- distro package - update the distro package version from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82935)
- dnf - Ensure that we are handling DownloadError properly in the dnf module
- dnf - Substitute variables in DNF cache path (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/80094).
- dnf - fix an issue where two packages of the same ``evr`` but different arch failed to install (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83406)
- dnf - honor installroot for ``cachedir``, ``logdir`` and ``persistdir``
- dnf - perform variable substitutions in ``logdir`` and ``persistdir``
- dnf, dnf5 - fix for installing a set of packages by specifying them using a wildcard character (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83373)
- dnf5 - fix traceback when ``enable_plugins``/``disable_plugins`` is used on ``python3-libdnf5`` versions that do not support this functionality
- dnf5 - re-introduce the ``state: installed`` alias to ``state: present`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83960)
- dnf5 - replace removed API calls
- ensure we have logger before we log when we have increased verbosity.

- vault_encrypted test documentation, name and examples have been fixed, other parts were clarified
- winrm - Add retry after exceeding commands per user quota that can occur in loops and action plugins running multiple commands.

Known Issues
------------

- ansible-test - When using ansible-test containers with Podman on a Ubuntu 24.04 host, ansible-test must be run as a non-root user to avoid permission issues caused by AppArmor.
- ansible-test - When using the Fedora 40 container with Podman on a Ubuntu 24.04 host, the ``unix-chkpwd`` AppArmor profile must be disabled on the host to allow SSH connections to the container.
