fixes:
  - |
    Only attempt to split nexus3_ports after we've checked that they exist, and
    wrap that attempt in a try/except so that bad ports won't break other parts
    of the job.
  - |
    Remove all instances of the gerrit_api.sanity_check function. This is too
    tightly coupled with other parts of the Gerrit API, and does not perform
    correctly in the git class.
