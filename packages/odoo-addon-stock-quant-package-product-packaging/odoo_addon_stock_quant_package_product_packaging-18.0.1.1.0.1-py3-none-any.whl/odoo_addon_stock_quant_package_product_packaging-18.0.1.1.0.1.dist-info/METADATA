This module allows to define on a Product Package (stock.quant.package),
a Packaging Type (product.packaging) that is linked to a product, if
said package only contains Quants (stock.quants) from this product, and
the sum of the quants quantities is equal to the Packaging quantity.

If such a packaging exists, it will be automatically assigned to a
package after the move is set to done.

The module also computes the package type of the package when products
are put in a package. The computation is done based on the number of
products in the package.
