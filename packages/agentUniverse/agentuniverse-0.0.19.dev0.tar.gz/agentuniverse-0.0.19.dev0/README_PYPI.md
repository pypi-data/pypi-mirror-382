# agentUniverse

## Overview
agentUniverse is a framework for developing applications powered by multi-agent base on large language model.  It provides all the essential components for building a single agent, and a multi-agent collaboration mechanism which  serves as a pattern factory that allowing developers to build and customize multi-agent collaboration patterns. With this framework,  developers can easily construct multi-agent applications, and share the pattern practices from different technical  and business fields.

The framework will come with several pre-install multi-agent collaboration patterns which have been proven effective in real business scenarios, and will continue to be enriched in the future. Patterns that are currently about to be released include:

- PEER pattern：
This pattern utilizes four distinct agent roles: Plan, Execute, Express, and Review, to achieve a multi-step breakdown and sequential execution of a complex task. It also performs autonomous iteration based on evaluative feedback which enhancing performance in reasoning and analytical tasks. 


- DOE pattern：
This pattern consists of three agents: Data-fining agent, which is designed to solve data-intensive and high-computational-precision task; Opinion-inject agent, which combines the data results from first agent and the expert opinions which are pre-collected and structured; the third agent, Express agent generates the final result base on given document type and language style.

More patterns are coming soon...
