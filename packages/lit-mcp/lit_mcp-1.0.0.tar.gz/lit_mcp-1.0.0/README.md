A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless access to academic literature databases, helping researchers accelerate their literature review process using LLMs and MCP clients like Claude, Cursor, and others.

## üöÄ Features

- **arXiv Integration**: Search and retrieve academic papers from arXiv
- **DBLP Integration**: Search computer science publications from DBLP database
- **AI-Powered Prompts**: Generate comprehensive research summaries and insights (usable as "/" commands)
- **MCP Compatible**: Works with any MCP client (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- **Structured Data**: Returns well-formatted paper metadata
- **Fast & Reliable**: Built on FastMCP for optimal performance
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new academic databases

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install UV (one-time setup)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Add to MCP Client

Simply add lit-mcp to your MCP client configuration - `uvx` will handle the rest automatically!

## üîå MCP Client Integration

### Cursor IDE

Add to your MCP configuration (usually in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lit-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["lit-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Other MCP Clients (Claude Desktop, etc.)</strong></summary>

Any MCP-compatible client can use lit-mcp with the same configuration pattern:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lit-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["lit-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**

Once configured, you can use the available tools in your MCP client:

```text
# Search tools
Search for 5 papers on "machine learning transformers" using arXiv.
Search for computer science papers on "GPS trajectory" using DBLP.

# AI-powered prompts (as "/" commands in Cursor)
/latest_info small language models
/related_topics transformer architectures  
/author_spotlight computer vision
```

</details>

## üéØ Real-World Example

We tested this MCP by adding to Cursor. The [output](./example/small-lang-models.md) was generated using the new AI-powered prompts and search tools. This comprehensive survey demonstrates the capabilities of lit-mcp:

**Generated using:**

- `latest_info` prompt for recent trends and innovations
- `related_topics` prompt for connected research areas  
- `author_spotlight` prompt for key researchers and collaborations
- `arxiv_search` tool for paper discovery and citations

**Original prompt:**
> I want to write a comprehensive survey paper on small language models. Can you create me a template along with fully detailed analysis of the contents? The writeup should be narrative (paragraph) style with minimal use of bullet points. Update to the file named small-lang-models.md and put the detailed contents there. Make sure to add accurate in-text citations as well to the content using markdown citation format, and also make sure to give the PDF links to all the papers. Use the arxiv tool.
