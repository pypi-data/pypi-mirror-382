Please resume this project from the stored state in RESTART.md.

Read and load the file:
./RESTART.md

This file contains all decisions, assumptions, commands, TODOs, and next steps
from the previous development session.

Follow these steps:
1. Read and internalize ./RESTART.md fully.
2. If you need clarification of rules or structure, refer (read-only) to:
   ./doc/CLINE_TASK_CURRENT.md
3. Then continue execution starting from the section **"Open TODOs / Next Steps"**
   in RESTART.md.
4. Before running or changing anything, verify that the environment and paths
   still match the documented setup.
5. Resume work autonomously until all remaining TODOs are complete,
   following the same verification and logging rules as defined in the task spec.

Do not re-generate or rewrite the initial planning phase unless RESTART.md
explicitly instructs you to.
