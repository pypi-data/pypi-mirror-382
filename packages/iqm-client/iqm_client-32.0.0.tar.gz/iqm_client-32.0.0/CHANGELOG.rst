Version 29.0.0 (2025-06-13)
===========================

Features
--------

- Major :class:`IQMClient` refactoring. Many methods now use :class:`StationControlClient` internally to retrieve the data,
  instead of using direct HTTP requests to REST API. This work is going to continue in the future, and the end goal
  is to remove all HTTP logic from :class:`IQMClient` and handle HTTP requests/responses only in :class:`StationControlClient`.
  :issue:`SW-1084`

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Remove :class:`APIVariant` from :class:`IQMClient`, it will support only one version at any given time from now on.
  Upgrade/downgrade software if you want to use different versions of :class:`IQMClient`. :issue:`SW-1084`
- You may have to pass a different `url` to :class:`IQMClient` than before:
  - If you previously used :class:`APIVariant.V1`, you typically need to change `/cocos` to `/station` in the URL.
  - If you previously used :class:`APIVariant.V2`, you typically need to add `/station` to the URL.
  - If you previously used :class:`APIVariant.RESONANCE_COCOS_V1`, no changes are needed to the URL.
- Support for ``timeout_secs`` parameter has been dropped from some methods (:meth:`get_static_quantum_architecture`,
  :meth:`get_quality_metric_set`, :meth:`get_calibration_set`, :meth:`get_dynamic_quantum_architecture`, :meth:`get_feedback_groups`).
  :class:`IQMClient` uses :class:`StationControlClient` to retrieve the data now instead of HTTP requests directly, and we have no
  plans to support different request timeout for each endpoint separately in :class:`StationControlClient`. Instead, all
  endpoints uses the same timeout which is currently set to default 120 seconds.
