# AstroForge

<p align="center">A Python library of astrodynamics tools.</p>

AstroForge is meant to be used for satellite state propagation and the computation of observations from ground-based or space-based sensors. Precise orbit fitting requires pristine knowledge of the observer’s site location in inertial coordinates, which in turn requires methodical handling of coordinate systems and the conversions between them. The goal of AstroForge is to make all of this **easy**.

## Installation

From this repository's top-level directory, run the command

```console
pip install .
```

## Usage

For details on how to use the various features of `AstroForge`, we recommend following the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory.

You can also read the project's documentation [here](https://astroforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
