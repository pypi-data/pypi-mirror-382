# Easier OpenAI

Easier OpenAI wraps the official OpenAI Python SDK so you can drive modern assistants, manage tool selection, search files, and work with speech from one helper packageâ€”the easiest possible way.

## What's Included
- Conversational `Assistant` helper with conversation memory and tool toggles.
- Temporary vector store ingestion to ground answers in local notes.
- Built-in helpers for image generation and text-to-speech playback.
- Speech-to-text recording shortcuts for quick dictation.
- Lazy-loaded imports so `import easier_openai` stays fast even when optional helpers expand.
- Optional `openai_function` decorator re-exported for function tool schemas.

## Installation
```bash
pip install easier-openai
```

Optional extras:
```bash
pip install "easier-openai[function_tools]"   # decorator helpers
pip install "easier-openai[speech_models]"    # whisper speech recognition models
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or pass it explicitly when constructing the assistant.

## Quick Start
```python
from easier_openai import Assistant

assistant = Assistant(api_key=None, model="gpt-4o", system_prompt="You are concise.")
response_text = assistant.chat("Summarize Rayleigh scattering in one sentence.")
print(response_text)
```

### Ground replies with your files
```python
notes = ["notes/overview.md", "notes/data-sheet.pdf"]
reply = assistant.chat(
    "Highlight key risks from the attached docs",
    file_search=notes,
    tools_required="auto",
)
print(reply)
```

### Generate speech from responses
```python
assistant.full_text_to_speech(
    "Ship a status update that sounds upbeat",
    model="gpt-4o-mini-tts",
    voice="alloy",
    play=True,
)
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer
- `openai>=1.43.0`
- `typing_extensions>=4.7.0`
- `pydantic>=2.0.0`
