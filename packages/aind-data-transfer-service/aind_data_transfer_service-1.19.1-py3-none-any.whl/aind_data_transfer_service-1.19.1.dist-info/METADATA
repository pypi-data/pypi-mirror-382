This service can be used to upload data stored in a VAST drive. It uses FastAPI to upload a job submission csv file that will be used to trigger a data transfer job in an on-prem HPC. Based on the information provided in the file, the data upload process fetches the appropriate metadata and starts the upload process.

More information can be found at [readthedocs](https://aind-data-transfer-service.readthedocs.io).
