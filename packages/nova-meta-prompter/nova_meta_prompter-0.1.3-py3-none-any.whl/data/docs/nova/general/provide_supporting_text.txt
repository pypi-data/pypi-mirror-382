<overview>
We recommend that you provide the model with trusted information relevant to the input query. This information, along with the input query, is generally a part of the system called retrieval augmented generation (RAG). In this process some relevant, contextual document or information is augmented to the actual user prompt so that the model gets trustworthy content to generate a relevant and accurate response. Instructing Amazon Nova to answer using a reference text from a trusted source can guide it to compose its response based on the provided material and ensure that its response is grounded in accurate and relevant information, enhancing the reliability and credibility of the generated content.

Additionally, using a reference text can help avoid hallucinating, thereby improving the overall quality and trustworthiness of the responses. To minimize hallucination, we recommend explicitly mentioning "DO NOT USE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT IN REFERENCE TEXTS!" in your model instructions.

<question>
What were the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the United States in 2020?
</question>

<reference_text>
In 2020, the United States experienced significant economic impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. economy contracted by 3.5% in 2020, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Unemployment rates surged to 14.7% in April 2020, the highest since the Great Depression, before gradually declining. Small businesses faced severe challenges, with millions of firms closing permanently. Additionally, consumer spending dropped sharply as people reduced non-essential expenditures and saved more. Government intervention played a critical role in mitigating these impacts through stimulus packages and support programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses and direct payments to individuals. Despite these measures, the economic recovery remained uneven across different sectors and regions.
