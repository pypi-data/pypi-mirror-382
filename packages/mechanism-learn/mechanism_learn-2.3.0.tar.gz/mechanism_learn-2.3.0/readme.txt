To run the experiment code, please install the mechanism-learn package using the distribution file 'mechanism_learn-2.2.1-py3-none-any.whl' in the 'dist' folder.

In Python, use: import mechanism_learn.pipeline to import the mechanism learning algorithms.

Please note that due to the limit of file size, we cannot attach all experiment data, such as ICH CT scans and the Background-MNIST data. The original ICH data is available at https://physionet.org/content/ct-ich/1.3.1/. For the Background-MNIST data, it is modified from the original MNIST dataset. This semi-synthetic Background MNIST dataset can be generated by using the Python code file: .\test_data\semi_synthetic_data\semi-synthetic_data_gen.py.
