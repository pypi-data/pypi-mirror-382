DANSy is an open-source software to analyze protein domain architectures by combining n-gram analysis and network approaches. DANSy represent proteins as sentences made up of domain words and constructs networks on the domain combinations in a set of given proteins. DANSy can be used to analyze either groups of proteins or to analyze the separation and enrichment of domain n-grams from gene or protein expression datasets.
