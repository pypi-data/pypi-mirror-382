Just letting you know about the recent event for {{event.build.machine}}.

Build {{event.build.build_id}} has been pushed to Gentoo Build Publisher.
{% if event.gbp_metadata and event.gbp_metadata.packages.built %}
The following packages were built:
{% for package in event.gbp_metadata.packages.built %}
â€¢ {{package.cpv}}
{%- endfor %}
{% else %}
No packages were built in this build.
{% endif %}
Thanks,
