class QuandelaQPUHandler(QPUHandler):
    """
    Quandela compatible version of myQLM ``QPUHandler`` class. This class is supposed to be the middleware between a user
    script, or a Qaptiva server and a single remote platform from Quandela.

    :param remote_processor: A constructed Perceval access to a remote platform which will be used to send requests and
                             retrieve results.

    This class can be used in two ways:

      * As an object
      * As a server

    Usage as an object:

    >>> from perceval_interop import QuandelaQPUHandler
    >>> from perceval import RemoteProcessor
    >>> from qat.core import Job
    >>>
    >>> myqlm_job = Job()
    >>> # Define your quantum experiment in the job
    >>> # ...
    >>> rp = RemoteProcessor("platform:name", "valid_access_token", "address.of.the.qpu.api")
    >>> handler = QuandelaQPUHandler(rp)
    >>> myqlm_result = handler.submit_job(myqlm_job)

    Usage as a server:

    >>> from perceval import RemoteProcessor
    >>> from perceval_interop import QuandelaQPUHandler
    >>>
    >>> rp = RemoteProcessor("platform:name", "valid_access_token", "address.of.the.qpu.api")
    >>> handler = QuandelaQPUHandler(rp)
    >>> handler.serve(host_ip="middleware.host.address", port=1212)

    After that, the ``QuandelaQPUHandler`` is listening to requests and transmitting them to the Quandela platform.
    User scripts may connect by running:

    >>> from qat.qpus import RemoteQPU
    >>> from qat.core import Job
    >>>
    >>> myqlm_job = Job()
    >>> # Define your quantum experiment in the job
    >>> # ...
    >>> qpu = RemoteQPU(1212, "middleware.host.address")
    >>> result = qpu.submit_job(myqlm_job)
