    Users provide Actions to their Actuator by implementing the `list_actions`
    method, which must return a `Sequence` of strands `DecoratedFunctionTools`.
    A `DecoratedFunctionTool` can be created by using strands's `@tool` decorator
    on a function/method. Once the user has provided this list of Actions, NovaAct
    parses the Action name, description, and signature from these and provides the
    information to the planning model.

    Actuators may also define the `domain` attribute. This is optional;
    when provided, it is used to ground the planning model to the specifics
    of the actuation environment.

    Actuators may also define custom `start` and `stop` methods, to be called
    when NovaAct enters and exits. Applications might include starting and
    stopping a required server or client; for example, an MCP ClientSession.
