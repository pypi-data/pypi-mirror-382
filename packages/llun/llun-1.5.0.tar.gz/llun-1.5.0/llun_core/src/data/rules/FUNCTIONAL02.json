  "description": "Operations should produce the same result when called multiple times with the same parameters. Repeated calls should not cause additional side effects or change the system state further.",
  "risk_if_violated": "Non-idempotent operations can cause data corruption, duplicate processing, or inconsistent states when network retries, user double-clicks, or system failures occur.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "violation": "A processPayment() method that charges the credit card every time it's called, even with the same transaction ID.",
      "better": "Check if a transaction with the same ID already exists and return the existing result instead of processing again."
    },
    {
      "violation": "An updateUserProfile() method that appends tags to a user's profile on every call, creating duplicates.",
      "better": "Replace the entire tag list or check for existing tags before adding, ensuring the same final state regardless of call count."
