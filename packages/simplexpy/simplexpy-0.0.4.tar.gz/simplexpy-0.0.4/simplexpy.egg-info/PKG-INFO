The **Simplex Python SDK** is a library designed to facilitate structural engineering computations, including foundation design, soil modeling, load analysis, and more. It provides a robust API for interacting with engineering data, performing calculations, and generating results in compliance with Eurocode standards.

## Getting Started

Assuming that you have a supported version of Python installed, you can first set up your environment with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
...
cd .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, you can install simplexpy from PyPI with:

```bash
python -m pip install simplexpy
```

## Documentation

Simplex has usage and reference documentation at [simplex-docs.onstrusoft.com](https://simplex-docs.onstrusoft.com/)

#

Prefer a UI? The Simplex web apps are backed by the same API and can be easier for quick checks, exploratory design, visualization, or when you don't need full scripting.
