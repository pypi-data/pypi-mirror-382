"""Core module providing rule defining capabilities.

When creating a new rule, one should inherit from a specific
`Rule` subclass, namely:

- [`lintkit.rule.Node`][] for a rule that is applied on a node
- [`lintkit.rule.File`][] for a rule that is applied on a whole file
- [`lintkit.rule.All`][] for a rule that has a check applied on all files

Tip:
    Check out [Advanced tutorial](/lintkit/tutorials/advanced)
    and [File tutorial](/lintkit/tutorials/file) to see all of them
    in real life examples.
