"""Unified `Value` type allowing rule application over multiple datatypes.

Warning:
    Multiline `ignore`s or skips are not supported
    for `TOML` due to `tomlkit` not returning line numbers
    of items.

Users should be mostly concerned about `Value` class, which wraps
items on a per-loader base and should be used with `Python`
nodes or `TOML` items (see `from_python` and `from_toml` class
methods).

Example:
```python
```

    Note:
        Instance of this type should __always__ be returned from
        [`lintkit.rule.Rule.values`][]

    Tip:
        You should use objects of this class __just like you would
        use the `value` directly.__ as it is a "perfect proxy".
        Its other functionalities __are used internally__ (e.g. `Pointer`)

    Can be essentially anything (e.g. `dict` from parsed `JSON`,
    `string` value from that `dict` or some other rule created value).

    It is later used by the pipeline to verify whether this value
    complies with the `Rule` itself.

    Tip:
        Use creation static methods (
        [`lintkit.Value.from_python`][],
        [`lintkit.Value.from_toml`][],
        or [`lintkit.Value.from_json`][]
        ) when returning
        values from rules inheriting from
        [`lintkit.loader.Python`][],
        [`lintkit.loader.TOML`][] or
        [`lintkit.loader.JSON`][]
        respectively.

    Caution:
        `YAML` __is already wrapped by [`lintkit.Value`][]__ during
        when using [`lintkit.loader.YAML`][], no need to process
        them within `values` function.

    Note:
        This `class` acts as a "perfect proxy" for end users
        by utilising [`wrapt`](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt)
        (which means wrapped `value` should be usable just like
        the original one).
