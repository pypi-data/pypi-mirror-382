class CircuitOperationList(list):
    """List of :class:`.CircuitOperation` objects representing a quantum circuit.

    The class is used to work with CircuitOperations directly. It is mostly meant as
    convenience to enable easy creation of circuits, calculations of their properties, and mapping them onto physical
    qubits. In addition to the circuit contents, this class has two important attributes:
    :attr:`qubits` and :attr:`table`.

    :attr:`qubits` defines the list of qubits which are allowed to be in the loci of all the
    CircuitOperations present in the list. Think about it as Qiskit's QuantumRegister.

    :attr:`table` is a :class:`.QuantumOpTable`, which contains all the
    :class:`.QuantumOp` s which are allowed in the circuit. In most cases, the table is
    simply taken to contain all the default operations defined in :mod:`iqm.pulse`.
    When you use this class with a :class:`.ScheduleBuilder`, it is good practice to set
    ``table = builder.op_table``. The QuantumOpTable is mutable, so any additional registered
    gates can automatically be usable in any CircuitOperationList associated with that
    ScheduleBuilder instance.

    The fundamental use of the class would be to first define a new instance:

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit = CircuitOperationList(num_qubits=2)

    The ``num_qubits`` parameter populates the :attr:`qubits` attribute with qubits QB1-QBn,
    in this case ``['QB1', 'QB2']``.

    Alternatively, you can provide ``qubits`` directly:

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit = CircuitOperationList(qubits=['QB1', 'QB2'])

    To add your own QuantumOpTable, initialize like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit = CircuitOperationList(num_qubits=2, table=my_table)

    Remembering that the table is mutable.

    If you already have a list of CircuitOperations, you can initialize with it:

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit = CircuitOperationList(circuit_ops, table=my_table)
        circuit.find_qubits()

    Calling the :meth:`find_qubits` method populates the :attr:`qubits` attribute with the qubits found in loci of
    the operations in the original circuit. If the list is empty, it will set :attr:`qubits` to an empty list,
    which most of the time is not what you want to do.

    The class has the ``__add__``, ``__mul__`` and ``__getitem__`` methods redefined, which means
    ``circuit * 3``, ``circuit1 + circuit2`` and ``circuit[0:4]`` will produce a CircuitOperationList
    with the same :attr:`qubits` and :attr:`table` attributes as the original.

    To add a ``prx`` operation to the list, call:

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit.add_op('prx', [0], angle, phase, impl_name='drag_crf')

    The class also has shortcut methods defined, so the above can be shortened to

    .. code-block:: python

        circuit.prx(angle, phase, 0, impl_name='drag_crf')

    which is exactly the same syntax as in Qiskit, with the addition of the implementation name
    which usually does not need to be used. The names of the shortcut methods are taken from the
    attached ``table`` at init. All the operations with non-zero arity
    will be added as shortcuts.

    If all the operations in the circuit are unitary, you can calculate the unitary propagator of
    the entire circuit by calling:

    .. code-block:: python

        U = circuit.get_unitary()

    The dimension of the unitary will always be defined by the :attr:`qubits` attribute. In particular, if your circuit
    contains 3 qubits, ``'QB1', 'QB2', 'QB3'``, but you only add gates to the first two, the resulting unitary will
    still be an 8x8 matrix, corresponding to the three qubits ``'QB1', 'QB2', 'QB3'``, in the big endian convention.
    With no operations affecting ``'QB3'``, the action of the unitary on this qubit is identity.

    To map the circuit onto physical qubits, all you need to do is call:

    .. code-block:: python

        physical_circuit = circuit.map_loci(physical_qubits)

    This will create a copy of the circuit, with all the placeholder qubits replaced by the physical qubits, with the
    order defined by the :attr:`qubits` attribute. For example, if ``qubits = ['QB1', 'Alice', 'ZZZ']``, and
    ``physical_qubits = ['QB2', 'QB5', 'QB10']``, all occurrences of ``'QB1'`` will be mapped to ``'QB2'``, ``'Alice'``
    to ``'QB5'`` and ``'ZZZ'`` to ``'QB10'``. The original circuit is not modified, so you can create many copies with
    different physical qubits, which is helpful when running parallel experiments on a large chip.

    Args:
        contents: Circuit operations to initialize the circuit with. Can be left out.
        qubits: Qubits allowed to be used in operation loci in the circuit.
        num_qubits: Number of qubits in the circuit, will initialize ``qubits`` with ``['QB1', 'QB2', ...]``.
