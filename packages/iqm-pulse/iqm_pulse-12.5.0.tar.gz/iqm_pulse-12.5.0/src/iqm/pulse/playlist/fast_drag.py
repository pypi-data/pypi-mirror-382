    r"""Evaluate Fourier transforms of cosine basis functions for given basis function indices and frequencies.

    The nth cosine basis function is given by :math:`g_n(t) = 1 -  \cos(2 \pi n t/t_p)` defined on the interval
    :math:`[0, t_p]`, where :math:`t_p` is the pulse duration. The Fourier transform can be analytically evaluated, see
    Eq. (A7) of :cite:`Hyyppa_2024`. We evaluate the Fourier transform for the basis function indices given by ``n_arr``
    and for the frequencies given by ``frequency_arr``. We store the Fourier transforms as a tensor of dimension
    ``1+dim(frequency_arr)``, such that the first dimension corresponds to the basis function indices, and the following
    dimensions to those of ``frequency_arr``. Thus, the Fourier transform is evaluated essentially for the cartesian
    product of ``n_arr`` and ``frequency_arr``.

            number of considered basis functions

    The base class describes control pulses, in which the coefficients of the basis functions
    are chosen to suppress specific frequencies or frequency ranges in the frequency spectrum of the pulse envelope.
    Examples include FAST DRAG and HD DRAG.

    The pulse argument ``compute_coefs_from_frequencies`` allows the user to choose whether the basis function
    coefficients are computed from ``suppressed_frequencies`` during the post-initialization of the pulse
    (thus, overriding any pre-computed values in ``coefficients``), or if the (pre-computed) values in ``coefficients``
    are directly used and ``suppressed_frequencies`` are neglected. The classes deriving from this base class should
