        In the idealized computational model we assume that in a (correctly calibrated) quantum computer
        there is no effective interaction between QPU components (in the computational frame and subspace) while
        a :class:`.Wait` instruction is acting on the flux channel of the coupler connecting those components
        (i.e., the coupler is idling).
        Hence a QPU component experiences no effective evolution if Wait instructions are
        acting on its drive, flux and probe channels, and the flux channels of all its couplers.

        Of course, in reality the QPU will experience at least some decoherence during a Wait, and
        possibly some crosstalk.
        In some applications, e.g. decoherence experiments, it is essential to Wait for a specific time,
        since it's precisely the decoherence that we are interested in.

        However, if we are only interested in applying well-defined local quantum operations on specific
        loci, it is essential to shut down all unwanted dynamics by adding :class:`.Block` instructions on
        control channels of the unused and neighboring channels.
        They act like Waits (and are converted into Waits at the end of the scheduling), but are allowed
        to overlap in time, since we are only interested in blocking those channels for the duration of the
        quantum operation.

        Args:
            schedule: instruction schedule to modify
            locus: information-carrying QPU components ``schedule`` is meant to operate on (does not include couplers)
            neighborhood: How far should we block neighboring QPU components?
                Zero means just the locus qubits, one means neighboring couplers, two means *their* neighboring
