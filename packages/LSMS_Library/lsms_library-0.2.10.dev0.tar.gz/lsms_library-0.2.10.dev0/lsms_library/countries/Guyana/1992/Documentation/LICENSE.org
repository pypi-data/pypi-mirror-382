/Public Use Files (PUFs)/Â are available to anyone agreeing to respect a
core set of easy-to-meet conditions. These data are made easily
accessible because the risk of identifying individual respondents or
data providers is considered to be low. Before gaining access to these
data, users are asked to register and to read and agree on the following
conditions.

- Data and other material provided by the Microdata Library will be used
  solely by the user, and shall not be redistributed or sold to other
  individuals, institutions or organizations without the Microdata
  Library's prior written agreement, and only subject to such conditions
  as may accompany such consent.

- The data will be used for statistical and scientific research purposes
  only. They will be used solely for generating, and perhaps reporting,
  aggregated information and not for investigations into specific
  individuals or organizations. In other words, the data shall be
  treated as a finished product - it may be used as a foundation for
  further work, but no reverse engineering or "upstream research" into
  the sources of the data itself will be permitted.

- No attempt will be made to identify respondents or microdata
  providers, and no use will be made of the identity of any person,
  facility or establishment discovered inadvertently. Any such discovery
  would immediately be reported to the Microdata Library, to allow us to
  evaluate further use, apply further statistical disclosure control
  methods, impose further restrictions on access, or appropriately
  re-classify the data.

- No attempt will be made to create links between datasets provided by
  the Microdata Library, or between Microdata Library data and other
  datasets that could identify individuals or organizations.

- Any books, articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, reports
  or other publications employing data obtained from the Microdata
  Library will cite the source, in line with the citation requirement
  provided with the dataset.

- The original collector of the data, the Microdata Library, and the
  relevant funding agencies bear no responsibility for any use of the
  data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.
