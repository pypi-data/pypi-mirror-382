Terms and conditions
Data and other material provided by the Microdata Library will be used solely by the user, and shall not be redistributed or sold to other individuals, institutions or organizations without the Microdata Library's prior written agreement, and only subject to such conditions as may accompany such consent.
The data will be used for statistical and scientific research purposes only. They will be used solely for generating, and perhaps reporting, aggregated information and not for investigations into specific individuals or organizations. In other words, the data shall be treated as a finished product - it may be used as a foundation for further work, but no reverse engineering or "upstream research" into the sources of the data itself will be permitted.
No attempt will be made to identify respondents or microdata providers, and no use will be made of the identity of any person, facility or establishment discovered inadvertently. Any such discovery would immediately be reported to the Microdata Library, to allow us to evaluate further use, apply further statistical disclosure control methods, impose further restrictions on access, or appropriately re-classify the data.
No attempt will be made to create links between datasets provided by the Microdata Library, or between Microdata Library data and other datasets that could identify individuals or organizations.
Any books, articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, reports or other publications employing data obtained from the Microdata Library will cite the source, in line with the citation requirement provided with the dataset.
The original collector of the data, the Microdata Library, and the relevant funding agencies bear no responsibility for any use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.
By continuing past this point to the data retrieval process, you signify your agreement to comply with the above-stated terms and conditions and give your assurance that the use of statistical data obtained from the National Data Archive will conform to widely-accepted standards of practice and legal restrictions that are intended to protect the confidentiality of respondents.
