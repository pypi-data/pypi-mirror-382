The Ghana Social Panel Survey (GhanaSPS) is one of two major surveys we have for Ghana, the other being the Ghana Living Standards Survey (Ghana LSS).
We have tried to make it possible to compare food expenditures not only across rounds within one of these surveys, but also across surveys.  The main tool needed for harmonization is a set of consistent food labels.  Those consistent labels are the "Aggregate Labels" found in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qZhbq5gpAmCsYH1ixUn0Ix_Cb5YKSIpU-Pc2_hh2lhU/.

** TODO ghana_sps.py
Contains code common to different GSPS rounds.
** TODO food_items.org
See discussion above for harmonization of food labels across rounds and surveys.  But we should provide code here to usefully extract that information.

** TODO conversion_to_kgs.json

** TODO other_features.py

'2013-14' has no regions or urban/rural data.

According to the data map, 'District codes need to be checked; may be good to harmonize across waves; may be good to integrate numerical codes and string names into numerical labeled variables; at least a few communities span two Eas--does that make sense? Rural/urban codes are missing from Wave 2; within Wave 1, there is some rural vs. urban inconsistency between public World Bank data and private PII data; there is some admin data from W1 that I haven't found in W2 that we may want to consider either removing from the dataset or pursuing in W2.'

So 2009-10 (Wave 1) has information but 2013-14 (Wave 2) does not. For now, all of 2013-14 has Ghana set as its region.
