CONFIDENTIALITY
The electronic datasets are organized by questionnaire with the following labels on file names in parentheses: household (hh), community (com), post-planting agriculture (pp), post-harvest agriculture (ph), and livestock (ls). The data within each questionnaire do not contain any constructed variables. For example, the ESS data provide most all variables needed to construct an estimate of total household consumption, but the data set does not contain an estimated value of total consumption. The only compiled data that are included with the ESS files are the geo-spatial variables The ESS collects confidential information on respondents. The confidential variables pertain to (i) names of the respondents to the household and community questionnaires, (ii) village and constituency names, (iii) descriptions of household dwelling and agricultural field locations, (iv) phone numbers of household members and their reference contacts, (v) GPS-based dwelling and agricultural field locations, (vi) names of the children of the head/spouse living elsewhere, (vii) names of the deceased household members, (viii) names of individuals listed in the network roster, and (ix) names of field staff. To maintain confidentiality, this information is not included in the ESS public use data. To partially satisfy user interest in geo-referenced location, while preserving the confidentiality of sample household and communities, modified EA-level coordinates are provided as part of the household geovariable table. Modified coordinates are generated by applying a random offset within a specified range to the average EA value (following the MeasureDHS approach). For households that have moved between waves 1 and 3, and are more than 5 km from their baseline location, the offset is with respect to the new household location. More specifically, the coordinate modification strategy relies on random offset of EA center-point coordinates (or average of household GPS locations by EA in ESS) within a specified range determined by the urban and rural classification. For small towns and urban areas, an offset range of 0-2 km is used. In rural areas, where communities are more dispersed and risk of disclosure may be higher, a range of 0-5 km offset is used. Additionally, an offset range of 0-10 km is applied to 1% of EAs, effectively increasing the known range for all points to 10 km while introducing only a small amount of noise. Offset points are constrained at the zone level, so that they still fall within the correct zone for spatial joins, or point-in-polygon overlays. The result is a set of coordinates, representative at the EA level, that fall within known limits of accuracy. Users should take into account the offset range when considering different types of spatial analysis or queries with the data. Analysis of the spatial relationships between locations in close proximity would not be reliable. However, spatial queries using medium or low-resolution datasets should be minimally affected by the offsets before being granted access to the dataset, all users have to formally agree: 1. To make no copies of any files or portions of files to which s/he is granted access except those authorized by the data depositor. 2. Not to use any technique in an attempt to learn the identity of any person, establishment, or sampling unit not identified on public use data files. 3. To hold in strictest confidence the identification of any establishment or individual that may be inadvertently revealed in any documents or discussion, or analysis. Such inadvertent identification revealed in her/his analysis will be immediately brought to the attention of the data depositor.
