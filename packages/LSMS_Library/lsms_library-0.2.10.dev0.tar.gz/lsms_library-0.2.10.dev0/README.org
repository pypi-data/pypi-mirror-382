A Python library providing a uniform interface to Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) household surveys from multiple countries and years, without the data loss typical of traditional harmonization approaches.

* The Problem

LSMS datasets are invaluable for studying poverty, consumption, and household welfare across developing countries. However, each country's survey uses different:
- Variable names and encodings
- Food classification systems
- Questionnaire structures
- File formats and organization

Researchers typically spend weeks learning each new dataset's idiosyncrasies or use pre-harmonized datasets that sacrifice detail and comparability. Cross-country or longitudinal analyses become prohibitively time-consuming.

* The Solution

LSMS_Library provides an *abstraction layer* that gives you a consistent interface to work with any supported LSMS dataset. Instead of harmonizing the data itself (which loses information), we harmonize the /way you access/ the data.

This means you can:
- Write analysis code once and apply it to multiple countries/years
- Switch between datasets without rewriting your code
- Preserve the full detail and structure of the original surveys
- Extend support to new surveys by writing simple YAML configuration files

* Quick Start

#+begin_src python
import lsms_library as ll

# Load a country's LSMS data
uga = ll.Country('Uganda')

# See available survey waves
print(uga.waves)
# ['2005-06', '2009-10', '2010-11', '2011-12', '2013-14', '2015-16', '2018-19', '2019-20']

# See available standardized data types
print(uga.data_scheme)
# ['people_last7days', 'food_acquired', 'food_expenditures', 'food_prices', 
#  'household_characteristics', 'income', 'nutrition', ...]

# Access standardized food expenditure data across all waves
food_exp = uga.food_expenditures()
# Returns a multi-indexed DataFrame with household, time, region, and food item
#+end_src

* Key Features

- *Uniform Interface*: Access variables using consistent names across countries (e.g., =food_expenditures()=, =household_characteristics()=)
- *Multi-Wave Panel Support*: For countries with panel surveys, household IDs are automatically standardized across waves, enabling longitudinal analysis without manual matching
- *Zero Data Loss*: Original data structure and detail preserved; access raw data through the same interface
- *Standardized Data Schemes*: Common data types (=food_prices=, =nutrition=, =income=, etc.) mapped across all countries
- *DVC Integration*: Stream data from remote storage without filling your disk
- *Extensible*: Add new surveys by creating YAML configuration files (no Python required)
- *Multiple Countries*: Supports LSMS surveys from Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Malawi, and more

* Installation

#+begin_src bash
pip install LSMS_Library
#+end_src

** Data Access

The library uses DVC (Data Version Control) to manage data stored in remote S3 buckets. To access the data, you'll need credentials:

- *Read access*: Contact ligon@berkeley.edu for read-only credentials to access the data
- *Write access (contributors)*: To contribute new datasets, contact ligon@berkeley.edu for write credentials. You'll need to establish [[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key][GPG/PGP credentials]] for secure access.

Once you have credentials, the library will handle data streaming automatically.

* Usage Examples

** Working with Food Consumption Data

#+begin_src python
import lsms_library as ll

# Load country data
uga = ll.Country('Uganda')
tza = ll.Country('Tanzania')

# Access food expenditure data with consistent structure
uga_food = uga.food_expenditures()
tza_food = tza.food_expenditures()

# Both return DataFrames with the same multi-index structure:
# Index: (household_id, time, region, food_item)
# Even though the original surveys have completely different formats

# Access other standardized data types
prices = uga.food_prices()
nutrition = uga.nutrition()
income = uga.income()
#+end_src

** Cross-Country Comparison

#+begin_src python
import lsms_library as ll
import pandas as pd

# Load multiple countries
countries = {
    'Uganda': ll.Country('Uganda'),
    'Tanzania': ll.Country('Tanzania'),
    'Nigeria': ll.Country('Nigeria')
}

# Collect food expenditure data from all countries
expenditure_data = {}
for name, country in countries.items():
    df = country.food_expenditures()
    df['country'] = name
    expenditure_data[name] = df

# Combine into a single DataFrame for analysis
combined = pd.concat(expenditure_data.values(), ignore_index=False)

# Now you can analyze across countries with consistent variable names
# e.g., compare rice prices, consumption patterns, etc.
#+end_src

** Panel Data Analysis

For countries with panel surveys, household IDs are already harmonized across waves:

#+begin_src python
import lsms_library as ll

# Load a country with panel data
uga = ll.Country('Uganda')

# Get food expenditures across all waves
food_exp = uga.food_expenditures()

# The multi-index includes time (wave), so you can track households over time
# Index levels: (household_id, time, region, food_item)

# Example: Track a specific household across waves
household_id = '00c9353d8ebe42faabf5919b81d7fae7'
household_over_time = food_exp.xs(household_id, level='i')

# Or analyze changes between specific waves
wave_2015 = food_exp.xs('2015-16', level='t')
wave_2019 = food_exp.xs('2019-20', level='t')

# Check panel structure and attrition patterns
panel_structure = ll.local_tools.panel_attrition(
    uga.household_characteristics(), 
    uga.waves
)
# Returns a matrix showing number of households appearing in each wave pair:
#         2005-06 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2013-14 2015-16 2018-19 2019-20
# 2005-06    3122    2606    2386    2363    1566    1470    1358    1290
# 2009-10     NaN    2974    2617    2581    1685    1578    1454    1379
# ...
# Diagonal shows total households per wave; off-diagonal shows panel overlap
#+end_src

** Exploring Available Data

#+begin_src python
import lsms_library as ll

uga = ll.Country('Uganda')

# See all available survey waves
print(uga.waves)
# ['2005-06', '2009-10', '2010-11', '2011-12', '2013-14', '2015-16', '2018-19', '2019-20']

# See all standardized data types available
print(uga.data_scheme)
# ['people_last7days', 'cluster_features', 'shocks', 'earnings',
#  'food_acquired', 'nutrition', 'household_characteristics',
#  'food_quantities', 'food_expenditures', 'food_prices',
#  'panel_ids', 'income', 'enterprise_income', 'other_features']

# Access any standardized data type using the same pattern
household_chars = uga.household_characteristics()
shocks = uga.shocks()
earnings = uga.earnings()
#+end_src

* Available Datasets

The library currently supports LSMS surveys from:
- *Ethiopia*: Multiple waves from the LSMS-ISA program
- *Malawi*: Multiple waves including panel data
- *Nigeria*: GHS-Panel surveys
- *Tanzania*: NPS surveys
- *Uganda*: UNPS surveys
- And more...

For a complete list of available surveys, see the country directories in the repository.

* Adding New Surveys

Adding a new LSMS survey requires no Python programming—just create YAML configuration files that map the survey's variables to the standardized interface. See [[file:CONTRIBUTING.org][CONTRIBUTING.org]] for detailed instructions.

Brief overview:
1. Create directory structure: =Country/Year/Documentation= and =Country/Year/Data=
2. Add source data using DVC
3. Create YAML files mapping variables to standard names
4. Submit a pull request

* Documentation

- *Food Classification*: Food items are standardized for spelling and format within each country. Note that food categories differ significantly across countries (e.g., what constitutes "Beans" in Uganda may not match Tanzania's classification), so cross-country food comparisons should be done carefully.
- *Variable Mappings*: YAML files in each survey directory show how local variables map to standard names
- *Panel IDs*: For countries with panel surveys, household identifiers are harmonized automatically across waves
- *API Reference*: [Coming soon]
