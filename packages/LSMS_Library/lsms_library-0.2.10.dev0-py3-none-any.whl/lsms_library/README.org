* Makefile
Some things you can do:

** Build files
This will build all the files associated with =COUNTRY=, where =COUNTRY= is a string corresponding to a directory name in the base directory of =LSMS_Library=:
#+begin_src sh
make build country=$(COUNTRY)   # E.g., make build country=Malawi
#+end_src

** Test files
This will test the structure and correctness of files that have been built:
#+begin_src sh
make test country=$(COUNTRY)   # E.g., make test country=Malawi
#+end_src

** Estimate Demands
This will construct an object to estimate  a CFE demand system:
#+begin_src sh
make demands country=$(COUNTRY) # E.g., make demands country=Malawi
#+end_src
* lsms_library
#+begin_src python
import lsms_library as ll

uga = ll.Country('Uganda')

x = uga.food_expenditures()

r = uga.cfe_demands()
#+end_src
