# Code style

When generating production code, always use full parameter and return type hints
for every function. Never generate useless inline comments that just reiterate
what the code is doing. It's okay to include comments in the rare case there is
something tricky going on.

When generating tests, always use parameter type hints, but never include the
`-> None` return type hint for a test function. For `pytest` fixtures, always
generate both the parameter and return type hints.

When generating tests, favor smaller, focused tests that use fixtures for reuse.
Don't include extraneous comments in the test code unless something needs more
clarity. Always generate a docstring using "should" language to describe the
aspect of the system the test is checking. Use simple direct language and avoid
sounding stuffy, but make these complete sentences.
