# Welcome to docket

Docket is a distributed background task system for Python functions with a focus
on the scheduling of future work as seamlessly and efficiently as immediate work.

## At a glance

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

from docket import Docket


async def greet(name: str, greeting="Hello") -> None:
    print(f"{greeting}, {name} at {datetime.now()}!")


async with Docket() as docket:
    await docket.add(greet)("Jane")

    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    soon = now + timedelta(seconds=3)
    await docket.add(greet, when=soon)("John", greeting="Howdy")
```

And in another process, run a worker:

```python
from docket import Docket, Worker

async with Docket() as docket:
    async with Worker(docket) as worker:
        await worker.run_until_finished()
```

Which produces:

```
Hello, Jane at 2025-03-05 13:58:21.552644!
Howdy, John at 2025-03-05 13:58:24.550773!
```

## Why docket?

‚ö°Ô∏è Snappy one-way background task processing without any bloat

üìÖ Schedule immediate or future work seamlessly with the same interface

‚è≠Ô∏è Skip problematic tasks or parameters without redeploying

üåä Purpose-built for Redis streams

üß© Fully type-complete and type-aware for your background task functions

## How It Works

docket integrates two modes of task execution:

1. **Immediate tasks** are pushed onto a Redis stream and are available to be picked up by any worker.
2. **Scheduled tasks** are pushed onto a Redis sorted set with a schedule time. A loop within each worker moves scheduled tasks onto the stream when their schedule time has arrived. This move is performed as a Lua script to ensure atomicity.

Docket requires a [Redis](http://redis.io/) server with Streams support (which was
introduced in Redis 5.0.0). Docket is tested with Redis 6 and 7.
