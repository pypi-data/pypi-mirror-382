---

## üöÄ Quick Start
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Claude Desktop (or any MCP-compatible client like Cursor)
- A Google account with access to Google Tag Manager

---

## üìã Complete Setup Guide
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
### Part 1: Install the Package

```bash
pip install gtm-mcp
```

See [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/gtm-mcp/)

### üîß Alternative Install Options

Instead of installing from PyPI, you can also install from source or from the built distributions:

#### 1. Install in development mode (editable)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paolobtl/gtm-mcp.git
cd gtm-mcp
pip install -e .
```

Useful if you plan to modify the code locally.
Changes in `src/gtm_mcp/` are immediately reflected.



Run this command from the same directory where `pyproject.toml` is located:
|Unix/macOS|Windows|
|---|---|
|`python3 -m build`|`py -m build`|

This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the `dist` directory.

#### 2. Install from built wheel

```bash
pip install dist/gtm_mcp-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### 3. Install from source tarball

```bash
pip install dist/gtm_mcp-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

### Part 2: Create Google Cloud OAuth Credentials
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click on the project dropdown (top left)
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Enter a project name (e.g., "My GTM MCP Server")
5. Click **"Create"**
6. Wait for the project to be created and select it

#### Step 2: Enable Tag Manager API

1. In your project, go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Library"**
2. Search for **"Tag Manager API"**
3. Click on it and click **"Enable"**
4. Wait for it to enable (may take a minute)

#### Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"OAuth consent screen"**
2. Select **"External"** (unless you have a Google Workspace)
3. Click **"Create"**
4. Fill in required fields:
   - **App name**: My GTM MCP (or whatever you like)
   - **User support email**: Your email
   - **Developer contact email**: Your email
5. Click **"Save and Continue"**
6. Click **"Update"** then **"Save and Continue"**
7. Add your email as a **test user**
8.  Click **"Save and Continue"**

#### Step 4: Create OAuth Credentials

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"**
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** ‚Üí **"OAuth client ID"**
3. Select **"Desktop app"** as the application type
4. Enter a name: "GTM MCP Desktop Client"
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **IMPORTANT**: A dialog appears with your credentials - **DO NOT CLOSE IT YET**

#### Step 5: Save Your Credentials

From the dialog that appeared:

1. Copy the **Client ID** (looks like: `123456789-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
2. Copy the **Client secret** (looks like: `GOCSPX-...`)
3. Note your **Project ID** from the Google Cloud Console (top bar, next to project name)
4. Save these somewhere safe - you'll need them in the next step

You can also download the JSON file, but you only need the three values above.

---

### Part 3: Configure Claude Desktop
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
Edit your Claude Desktop config file:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Code** `~/.claude.json`

Add your credentials:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gtm-mcp": {
      "command": "gtm-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GTM_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "GTM_CLIENT_SECRET": "GOCSPX-your-client-secret",
        "GTM_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace the values** with your actual credentials from Part 2, Step 5.

> **Note**: If you have other MCP servers configured, just add the `"gtm-mcp"` entry to the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

---

### Part 4: Restart and Authorize
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (close and reopen)

2. Ask Claude to use a GTM tool (e.g., "List my GTM accounts")

3. **First-time authorization** - a browser window will open automatically:
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - You'll see **"Google hasn't verified this app"** warning
   - Click **"Advanced"** ‚Üí **"Go to [Your App Name] (unsafe)"**
   - This is safe because **you created the app yourself**
   - Grant the requested permissions
   - You'll see "The authentication flow has completed"
   - Return to Claude Desktop

4. Your authorization is saved locally - you won't need to do this again!

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server) </br>

## üîê How Authentication Works
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server) </br>
This MCP server uses **OAuth 2.0** to securely access Google Tag Manager:

1. **You create OAuth credentials** in your own Google Cloud project
2. **You configure** those credentials in Claude Desktop
3. **First use**: Browser opens to authorize access to your GTM account
4. **Your tokens** are saved locally on your machine (`~/.gtm-mcp-token.json`) for future use

### Why Do I Need My Own OAuth Credentials?

For security and privacy:
- ‚úÖ You maintain full control over the OAuth app
- ‚úÖ No shared credentials between users
- ‚úÖ You can revoke access anytime
- ‚úÖ Your credentials stay private
- ‚úÖ Compliant with Google's OAuth policies

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
### "Missing required OAuth credentials" Error

**Problem**: The MCP server can't find your credentials.

**Solution**: Make sure you:
- Set the environment variables correctly in `claude_desktop_config.json` (or `~/.claude.json`)
- Restarted Claude Desktop after editing the config
- Used the correct format (no extra quotes in JSON)
- The config file is valid JSON (use a JSON validator if unsure)

### "Google hasn't verified this app" Warning

**Problem**: Google shows a security warning during first authorization.

**Solution**: This is **completely normal** for personal OAuth apps. Since you created the OAuth app yourself, Google shows this warning.

To proceed: Click **"Advanced"** ‚Üí **"Go to [App Name] (unsafe)"**

This is safe because **you control the app**.

### Can't Access GTM Accounts

**Possible causes**:
- Your Google account doesn't have access to any GTM accounts
- You didn't grant all requested permissions during authorization
- Tag Manager API isn't enabled in your Google Cloud project

**Solution**:
1. Verify your Google account has GTM access
2. Re-authorize by deleting `~/.gtm-mcp-token.json` and trying again
3. Check that Tag Manager API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

### Connection Issues

**Debugging steps**:
1. Verify Claude Desktop is completely restarted
2. Check Claude Desktop logs for MCP server errors
3. Verify `gtm-mcp` command works: run `gtm-mcp` in terminal
4. Check your config file is valid JSON
5. Ensure all three environment variables are set correctly

### Package Not Found After Install

**Problem**: `gtm-mcp` command not found after installation.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure pip install location is in PATH
pip install --user gtm-mcp

# Or use pipx for isolated installation
pipx install gtm-mcp
```

### Revoking Access

To revoke access to your GTM account:
1. Go to [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find your app name in the list
3. Click **"Remove access"**
4. Delete the local token file: `rm ~/.gtm-mcp-token.json`

You can re-authorize anytime by using any GTM tool in Claude again.

## üîí Security Notes
[‚¨Ü top](#gtm-mcp-server)
- **Your OAuth credentials are yours alone** - keep them private
- **Never share your Client Secret** - treat it like a password
- Your access tokens are stored locally: `~/.gtm-mcp-token.json`
- You can regenerate credentials anytime in Google Cloud Console
- You can revoke access anytime from your Google account settings
- This server only accesses GTM - no other Google services
