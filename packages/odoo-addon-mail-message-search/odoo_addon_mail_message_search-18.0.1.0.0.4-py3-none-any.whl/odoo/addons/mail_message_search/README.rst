This module enables searching for messages across any record that uses
the chatter, based on their associated conversation threads. It
dynamically adds a Message Search field to the search view of any model
that inherits from ``mail.thread``.

The Message Search field performs a smart, per-word search across a
message’s subject, body, sender, and reply-to fields.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module offers an alternative to ``base_search_mail_content``,
designed to better support languages that do not separate words with
spaces (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai).

The original module relies on PostgreSQL's ``pg_trgm``, which requires
three-character tokens and a similarity score above the default
cutoff—making it ineffective for languages without space-separated
words.

This module uses direct keyword matching across key fields in
``mail.message``, offering more reliable results in multilingual
environments.

Usage
=====

Go to any model that contains a chatter (e.g. Contacts, ...). Search for
content in field 'Message Search'.
