# Abstract

Testing software across diverse hardware presents a formidable challenge in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Differences in operating systems, hardware configurations, and environments can lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs, making comprehensive testing critical yet complex. nvtest is a powerful new tool that serves as both a testing framework and a test runner, designed to efficiently manage software testing across varied hardware setups efficiently.

Software testing has evolved  from manual checks to sophisticated automated frameworks, reflecting the industry's growing complexity and the need for more robust testing solutions. Traditional tools often struggle to keep pace with the swift cycles of development and the broad spectrum of testing environments required. nvtest addresses these challenges by offering a solution that not only facilitates the creation and organization of test cases but also streamlines their execution across different hardware and environments.

At its core, nvtest is distinguished by its dual functionality. As a testing framework, it provides the necessary infrastructure for defining, organizing, and maintaining test cases, emphasizing adaptability to cater to the unique demands of each project. This adaptability is further supported by nvtest's plugin architecture, enabling integration with a variety of development tools and CI/CD systems such as GitLab, CMake, and JUnit.

As a test runner, nvtest executes tests asynchronously, significantly cutting down the time needed to run extensive test suites. This feature is invaluable in continuous integration settings, where rapid feedback is crucial for development efficiency. Furthermore, nvtest's hardware-agnostic approach ensures that tests can be executed effectively, whether on local machines, in cloud-based platforms, or on high-performance computing clusters, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in software testing today.

This presentation will delve into practical examples and use case scenarios that demonstrate nvtest's versatility and power in solving real-world testing challenges. Attendees will learn how to integrate nvtest into their development workflows, leveraging its features to improve test coverage, reduce testing times, and ultimately elevate the quality of their software products.
