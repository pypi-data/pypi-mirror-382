Running tests in a batch scheduler
==================================

Execution in a batch scheduler is accomplished by defining the scheduler and batching scheme on the
command line:

.. code-block:: console

    canary run -b scheduler=(slurm|flux|pbs|shell) -b spec=[(count:(N|max|auto)|duration:T)][,layout:(flat|atomic)][,nodes:(any|same)] PATH

For example, to run the example suite using the ``shell`` scheduler in 4 batches:

.. command-output:: canary run -b scheduler=shell -b spec=count:4 .
    :cwd: /examples
    :setup: rm -rf TestResults
    :returncode: 30
    :nocache:

.. note::

    The ``shell`` scheduler submits batches to the user's shell in a subprocess and is intended for demonstration purposes only.  It should not be used outside of running small examples.
