Finding locations of test assets
================================

It is often useful to know the location a test's execution directory.  The :ref:`canary location<canary-location>` command can display the locations of test assets:


.. command-output:: canary location -h

For example to move to the test execution directory, simply:

.. code-block:: console

    cd $(canary location /ID)

where ``ID`` is the test ID that is printed by :ref:`canary status<basics-status>`.

.. note::

   ``ID`` must be prefixed by ``/``.

.. note::

    ``canary location`` should be run inside of a test session by either navigating to the session's directory or by ``canary -C PATH``.
