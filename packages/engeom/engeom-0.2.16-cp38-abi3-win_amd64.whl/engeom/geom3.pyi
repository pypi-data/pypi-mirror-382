        """
        This function reads a LPTF3 file, which is a compact file format for storing 3D point data
        taken from a laser profile triangulation scanner. The format is simple and compact, capable
        of practically storing about 200k points (with an 8-bit color value each) per MB when using a
        16-bit coordinate format, or half that when using a 32-bit coordinate format.

        There are a few different ways to load the data, controlled by the `Lptf3Load` enum:
          - `Lptf3Load.All`: Load all points from the file.
          - `Lptf3Load.TakeEveryN(n)`: Load every Nth row from the file. The loader will attempt to
            roughly match the x spacing of the points to the gap distance between rows, resulting in a
            grid-like point cloud with an approximately uniform point spacing when viewed from the
            X-Y plane.  This is a very fast method of retrieving a downsampled set of points.
          - `Lptf3Load.SmoothSample(params)`: Load the points using a downsampling filter, which
            downsamples the point cloud similar to the `TakeEveryN` method, but also performs a gaussian
            smoothing step using the full original cloud.  This takes the longest time, but can remove
            a significant amount of noise from the data by making use of an adjacency structure that
            will be lost once the points are turned into a mesh.

        Once the points are loaded, they will be converted into a triangle mesh by connecting points in adjacent
        rows with triangles that meet certain edge length criterial. The result is a fast mesh that can be built
        using knowledge of the LPTF3's internal structure rather than having to rely on more general techniques

        flipped so that it points in the same direction as the mesh surface normal.

        The first point `.a` of the measurement is the point on the mesh, and the second point `.b` is the test point

        In both cases, the deviation will be positive if the point is outside the surface and negative if the point is
        inside the surface.

        This method is appropriate for measuring the deviation at a few points of interest, returning a rich object

        This method will perform a conformal mapping of the mesh to the XY plane using the boundary-first flattening

        flattened mesh, and is useful for applications such as texture mapping or transformation to an image/raster
        space for analysis.

        There are a number of limitations to this method based on the implementation:

        * There can be no non-manifold edges in the mesh.  Non-manifold edges are edges that have more than two faces
          connected to them. If there are non-manifold edges, the method will raise an exception.

        * There must be a single patch (sets of faces connected by common edges) in the mesh. If there are multiple
          patches, the method will raise an exception.

        * There can be only one boundary loop in the mesh, meaning that there can be no holes. If there are holes, the
          method will raise an exception.

        The method will return a numpy array of shape (n, 2) containing the flattened vertices of the mesh in the XY
        plane. There is no specific orientation or position guarantee to the output vertices, so they may need to be
        transformed, scaled, and/or rotated to fit a specific application.

        The 2D vertices in the output will be in the exact same order as those in the mesh and will have a 1:1
        correspondence by index, meaning that the `faces` array from the mesh also describes the triangles in the
