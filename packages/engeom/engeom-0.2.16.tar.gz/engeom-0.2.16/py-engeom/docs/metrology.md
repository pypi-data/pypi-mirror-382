# Metrology

!!! warning
    The metrology feature set is still experimental and is under heavy development in the Rust `engeom` library.
    Expect significant changes to the API in the future.
    
## Introduction

The metrology features of the `engeom` library are designed to provide a common set of tools for actual measurements,
separate from the geometry tools. For example, measurements like scalar distances, areas, GD&T form and position 
measurements, and more, will be consolidated as entities and operations in the metrology features.
