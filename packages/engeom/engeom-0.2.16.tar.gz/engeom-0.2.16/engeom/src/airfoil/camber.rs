/// Attempts to calculate and extract the mean camber line from an airfoil section curve and its
/// convex hull using the inscribed circle method.
///
/// Functionally, this algorithm will work by first finding the farthest pair of points on the
/// convex hull, then bisecting the section at the halfway point of that longest span to create the
/// initial station. From there, the algorithm will advance along the camber direction, first in
/// one direction and then in the other, to extract the camber line. At each inscribed circle,
/// it will attempt to move forward by a fraction of the last circle's radius, incrementally
/// reducing the forward motion down to a minimum threshold when it encounters problems. As it
/// advances it looks forward for the farthest point in the section in the ever-updating camber
/// direction, and will terminate the search when the distance to that farthest point beyond the
/// last inscribed circle is less than a minimum threshold of the last circle's radius.
///
/// As it advances, it will look at the interpolation error between the inscribed circles and add
/// new circles between them when the error is above a certain tolerance, refining the camber line
/// to within the specified tolerance.

/// * `section`: the airfoil section curve
