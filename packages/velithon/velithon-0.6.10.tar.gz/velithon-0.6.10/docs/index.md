## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started with Velithon in just a few minutes:

### Installation

```bash
pip install velithon
```

### Your First App

```python title="main.py"
from velithon import Velithon

app = Velithon()

@app.get("/")
async def hello_world():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    return {"user_id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app._serve(
        app="main:app",
        host="0.0.0.0", 
        port=8000,
        workers=1,
        log_level="INFO"
    )
