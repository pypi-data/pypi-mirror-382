## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10+** installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of **Python** and **async/await**
- Familiarity with **HTTP concepts** (requests, responses, status codes)
- A **text editor** or **IDE** (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

!!! tip "New to Async Python?"
    If you're new to asynchronous programming in Python, check out the [Python async/await documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) before diving into Velithon.

## ðŸš€ Quick Overview

Velithon is designed to be intuitive and developer-friendly. Here's a taste of what you'll be building:

```python
from velithon import Velithon
from velithon.responses import JSONResponse

app = Velithon()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to Velithon!"}

@app.post("/items")
async def create_item(item: dict):
    # Process the item
    return JSONResponse({"created": item}, status_code=201)
```

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

We recommend following the sections in order:

1. **Installation** - Get Velithon installed and ready
2. **Quick Start** - Your first "Hello World" application
3. **First Application** - A more realistic example with multiple features
4. **Project Structure** - Organize your code like a pro

Each section builds upon the previous one, so you'll gradually become proficient with all of Velithon's features.
