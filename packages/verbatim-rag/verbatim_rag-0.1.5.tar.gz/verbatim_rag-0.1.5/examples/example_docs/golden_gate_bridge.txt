The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County.

Construction began on January 5, 1933, and the bridge was opened to vehicular traffic on May 28, 1937. The project was completed under budget at a cost of $35 million (equivalent to $650 million in 2019) and ahead of schedule.

The bridge is painted in a distinctive color officially called "International Orange." The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow because it complements the natural surroundings and enhances the bridge's visibility in fog. The U.S. Navy had originally requested that the bridge be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.

The Golden Gate Bridge had the longest main span in the world at 4,200 feet (1,280 m) when it was completed in 1937. It held this record until the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City was opened in 1964.

The bridge's two towers rise 746 feet (227 m) above the water and were the tallest structures in San Francisco until 1964. The weight of the roadway is hung from two cables that pass through the two main towers and are fixed in concrete at each end. Each cable is made of 27,572 strands of wire, and the total length of wire used is approximately 80,000 miles (130,000 km).

The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The bridge carries both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait.
