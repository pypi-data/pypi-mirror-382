## 💾 **Session Management**

### Session Persistence
Sessions are automatically tracked with complete metadata:
- Provider and model information
- System prompts and configuration
- Tool usage and preferences
- Conversation patterns

### Cross-Session Knowledge
Knowledge accumulates across sessions:
- User preferences persist
- Domain expertise grows
- Problem-solving patterns emerge
- AI personality develops

### Export & Import Capabilities
```bash
# Save current session state
/save my_session.pkl

# Load previous session
/load my_session.pkl

# Export memory for analysis
/export session_analysis.json
```

### Storage Reset Options
AbstractLLM provides flexible reset capabilities for different scenarios:

#### Current Session Reset
```bash
# Reset only the current session (preserves all other sessions)
/reset
```
**What it does:**
- Clears current conversation history
- Resets working memory and knowledge graph
- Preserves all LanceDB storage (other sessions remain intact)
- Maintains embeddings cache for performance

#### Complete Storage Purge
```bash
# ⚠️  WARNING: Permanently deletes ALL storage across all sessions
/reset full
```
**What it does:**
- **PERMANENTLY DELETES** all sessions from all users
- Removes all interaction history with embeddings
- Deletes all ReAct cycles and reasoning traces
- Purges complete LanceDB database
- Removes all cached embeddings
- Reinitializes fresh storage

**Safety Features:**
- Requires typing "DELETE" to confirm
- Double confirmation with "yes"
- Cannot be undone
- Clear warnings about permanent data loss

**Use Cases:**
- `/reset` - Start fresh conversation while keeping history
- `/reset full` - Complete privacy purge or troubleshooting

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### 1. **Effective Search Queries**
```bash
# Good: Specific and descriptive
/search React hooks useState debugging

# Better: Include context
/search React functional components state management

# Best: Natural language with intent
/search "why is my React component not re-rendering when state changes"
```

### 2. **Time-Based Analysis**
```bash
# Daily analysis
/timeframe 2025-09-15T00:00 2025-09-15T23:59

# Work session analysis
/timeframe 2025-09-15T09:00 2025-09-15T17:00

# Specific meeting or task
/timeframe 2025-09-15T14:00 2025-09-15T15:30
```

### 3. **Knowledge Discovery**
```bash
# Start broad, then narrow
/search programming
/search Python programming
/search Python async programming

# Use similarity for discovery
/similar "decorator pattern"
/similar "async await best practices"
```

### 4. **Pattern Recognition**
```bash
# Find recurring issues
/search error TypeError

# Analyze solution patterns
/similar "fixed the bug by"

# Track learning evolution
/search "I don't understand" --from 2025-01-01
```

## 🚀 **Pro Tips**

### 1. **Leveraging Memory Across Sessions**
- Start new sessions by searching previous related discussions
- Use `/similar` to find relevant past solutions
- Build on previous learning with `/search` queries

### 2. **Debugging with History**
- Search for similar error messages: `/search "TypeError: 'NoneType'"`
- Find past debugging approaches: `/similar "debugging strategy"`
- Analyze bug resolution patterns over time

### 3. **Learning Acceleration**
- Find knowledge gaps: `/search "I don't understand"`
- Track concept evolution: `/timeframe` for specific learning periods
- Connect related topics: `/similar` for concept relationships

### 4. **Project Continuity**
- Resume work with context: `/search project_name --from yesterday`
- Find architectural decisions: `/similar "decided to use"`
- Track feature development: `/timeframe` during development periods

## 🎉 **Getting Started Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: New User
```bash
# Start a conversation
user> How do I implement caching in Python?

# After getting a response, explore related topics
/search caching performance optimization
/similar "memory management Python"
```

### Scenario 2: Returning User
```bash
# Find where you left off
/search machine learning --from 2025-09-14
/timeframe 2025-09-14T15:00 2025-09-14T18:00

# Continue learning
user> Let's continue with neural network optimization
```

### Scenario 3: Debugging Expert
```bash
# Find similar bug patterns
/search segmentation fault debugging
/similar "core dump analysis"

# Analyze debugging evolution
/timeframe 2025-09-01 2025-09-15
```

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### LanceDB Not Available
If you see `LanceDB observability not available`:
```bash
pip install lancedb sentence-transformers
```

### Search Returns No Results
- Check spelling and try different keywords
- Use broader search terms initially
- Verify timeframes are correct for `/timeframe`

### Performance Issues
- Embeddings are cached - first searches may be slower
- Storage grows over time - use `/stats` to monitor
- Consider cleanup of very old sessions if needed

---

## 🌟 **Advanced Features**

### Custom Embedding Models
The system uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by default for optimal speed/quality balance. Future versions will support custom embedding models.

### Multi-User Support
The system is designed for multi-user environments with proper isolation and user management.

### API Integration
All LanceDB functionality is available programmatically through the `ObservabilityStore` and `EmbeddingManager` classes.
