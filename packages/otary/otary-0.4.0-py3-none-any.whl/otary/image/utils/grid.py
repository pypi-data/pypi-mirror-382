"""
Grid-based computations.

Local computation are done using a window that is shifted by 1 pixel in each
direction.

Grid-based computations are more efficient than local computations.
They are done using a grid of size w and a shift of w.

So for a (height, width) grayscale image with a grid of size (w, w), the number of
computations is N = height * width / w**2. Then
