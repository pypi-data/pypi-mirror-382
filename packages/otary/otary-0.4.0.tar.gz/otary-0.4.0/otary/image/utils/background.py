"""
Computing a Background Surface Estimation (BSE) is a way of locally estimating the
local average background in order to correct the foreground by this local value
everywhere in the image.

This can be useful as an intermediate step for several binarization methods like
Gatos or AdOtsu (Adaptive Otsu Thresholding).

Generally, the Background Estimation is computed thanks to two elements:
1. the input image
2. a rough binarization of the input image.

The rough binarization is usually computed with a method like Otsu or Sauvola since
those methods are considered as classics for binarization.

    r"""Background Surface Estimation using the Gatos paper called:
    "Adaptive degraded document image binarization".

    This background estimation is maybe the most natural one. It first computes the
    a rough binarization of the input image. It updates the pixels of the input image
    where the rough binarization is 0 (foreground, meaning probably text) by an
    local average around each pixels using only the values of the pixels that are
    1 (background). The pixels where the rough binarization is 1 (background) remain
    unchanged.

    Here is the mathematical formula:

    $$
    B(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
    I(x,y) & if \ S(x,y)) = 1 \\
    \dfrac{\sum_{x_i = x - dx}^{x+dx}\sum_{y_i = y - dy}^{y+dy}I(x_i, y_i) S(x_i, y_i)}
    {\sum_{x_i = x - dx}^{x+dx}\sum_{y_i = y - dy}^{y+dy}S(x_i, y_i)} & if \ S(x,y) = 0
    \end{array} \right.
