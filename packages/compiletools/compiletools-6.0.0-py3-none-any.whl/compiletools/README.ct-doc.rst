SYNOPSIS
========
    ct-* [compilation args] [filename.cpp] [--variant=<VARIANT>]

DESCRIPTION
===========
The various ct-* tools exist to build C/C++ executables with almost no 
configuration. For example, to build a C or C++ program, type

.. code-block:: bash

    ct-cake --auto

which will try to determine the correct source files to generate executables
from and also determine the tests to build and run.

A variant is a configuration file that specifies various configurable settings
like the compiler and compiler flags. Common variants are "debug" and "release".

Options are parsed using python-configargparse.  This means they can be passed
in on the command line, as environment variables or in config files.
Command-line values override environment variables which override config file 
values which override defaults. Note that the environment variables are 
captilized. That is, a command line option of --magic=cpp is the equivalent of 
an environment variable MAGIC=cpp.

If the option itself starts with a hypen then configargparse can fail to parse 
it as you intended. For example, on many platforms,

.. code-block:: bash

    --append-CXXFLAGS=-march=skylake

will fail. To work around this, compiletools postprocesses the options to 
understand quotes. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    --append-CXXFLAGS="-march=skylake" 

will work on all platforms.  Note however that many shells (e.g., bash) will strip 
quotes so you need to escape the quotes or single quote stop the shell preprocessing. 
For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    --append-CXXFLAGS=\\"-march=skylake\\"  
    or 
    --append-CXXFLAGS='"-march=skylake"'

SHARED OBJECT CACHE
===================
compiletools supports a shared object file cache for multi-user/multi-host
environments. When enabled via ``shared-objects = true`` in ct.conf, object files
are stored in a content-addressable cache that can be safely accessed concurrently
by multiple users and build hosts.

Key features:

* **Content-addressable storage**: Object files named by source + flags hash
* **Multi-user safe**: Group-writable cache with proper locking
* **Cross-host compatible**: Works on NFS, GPFS, Lustre filesystems
* **Stale lock detection**: Automatic cleanup of locks from crashed builds
* **Minimal configuration**: Just set ``shared-objects = true`` in config

Example setup for shared cache:

.. code-block:: bash

    # In ct.conf or variant config
    shared-objects = true
    objdir = /shared/nfs/build/cache

    # Ensure cache directory is group-writable with SGID
    mkdir -p /shared/nfs/build/cache
    chmod 2775 /shared/nfs/build/cache

Other notable tools are

.. code-block:: text

    * ct-headertree: provides information about structure of the include files
    * ct-filelist:   provides the list of files needed to be included in a tarball (e.g. for packaging)
