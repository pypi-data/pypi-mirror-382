# specflow

> JSON Schema validation that just flows

## üöß Coming Soon

**specflow** is an upcoming JSON schema validator designed to make schema validation elegant and effortless.

## Vision

Part of the `*flow` family (alongside [confflow](https://github.com/pedrojosemoragallegos/confflow) and [structflow](https://github.com/pedrojosemoragallegos/structflow)), specflow aims to bring the same intuitive developer experience to JSON schema validation.

### Use Cases

- **API Development** - Validate request and response payloads
- **Configuration Management** - Ensure config files match expected schemas
- **Data Pipelines** - Validate data at every transformation step
- **AI Agents** - Help AI systems validate and structure their outputs reliably
- **Form Validation** - Client and server-side form data validation
- **Testing** - Assert that data structures match specifications

### What to Expect

- **Simple API** - Validate JSON against schemas with minimal boilerplate
- **Clear Error Messages** - Understand what went wrong and where
- **AI Agent Ready** - Structured validation feedback perfect for LLM tool use and agentic workflows
- **Type-Safe** - Built with TypeScript-first design
- **Composable** - Chain validations and transform data seamlessly
- **Standards Compliant** - Full JSON Schema specification support

## The Flow Philosophy

Like its siblings, specflow follows these principles:

- **Zero configuration** to get started
- **Intuitive APIs** that feel natural
- **Excellent developer experience** with helpful feedback
- **Production-ready** performance and reliability
