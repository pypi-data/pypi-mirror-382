### Websocket Usage
```python
from tradingapi_b.mticker import *
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

#Testing Web Socket or MTicker
m_ticker=MTicker("<API_KEY>","<ACCESS_TOKEN>","<WEB_SOCKET_URL>")


def on_ticks(ws, ticks):
    # Callback to receive ticks.
    logging.info("Ticks: {}".format(ticks))

def on_order_update(ws,data):
    #Callback to receive Order Updates
    logging.info("On Order Updates Packet received : {}".format(data))

def on_trade_update(ws,data):
    #Callback to receive Trade Updates
    logging.info("On Trade Updates Packet received : {}".format(data))

def on_connect(ws, response):
    # Callback on successful connect.
    m_ticker.send_login_after_connect()
    # Subscribe to a list of instrument_tokens 
    ws.subscribe("NSE",[5633])
    print("Connected to socket and logged in successfully")

def on_close(ws, code, reason):
    # On connection close stop the event loop.
    # Reconnection will not happen after executing `ws.stop()`
    ws.stop()

# Assign the callbacks.
m_ticker.on_ticks = on_ticks
m_ticker.on_connect = on_connect
m_ticker.on_close = on_close
m_ticker.on_order_update=on_order_update
m_ticker.on_trade_update=on_trade_update

# Infinite loop on the main thread. Nothing after this will run.
# You have to use the pre-defined callbacks to manage subscriptions.
m_ticker.connect()


logging.info('Now Closing Web socket connection')

m_ticker.close()

logging.info('Testing complete')


```

### Running Unit Tests

This requires having pytest library pre installed. You can install the same via pip:

``` pip install pytest ```

Navigate to the ```unit``` directory and run the ```connect_test.py``` file using pytest

```
cd unit
pytest connect_test.py
```
