- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.0.1. This fixes a bug in the reported FRAMEVOL key in L1 headers. (`#154 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/154>`__)


v1.2.0 (2024-09-23)
===================

Features
--------

- Reorder task dependencies in workflows. Movie and L1 quality tasks are no longer dependent on the presence of OUTPUT
  frames and thus can be run in parallel with the `WriteL1` task. (`#152 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/152>`__)


Misc
----

- Use CALIBRATED instead of OUTPUT frames in post-science movie and quality tasks. This doesn't change their output at all (the arrays are the same), but
  it's necessary for `dkist-processing-common >= 10.0.0` that will break using OUTPUT frames. (`#151 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/151>`__)
- Remove `AssembleCryonirspMovie` as workflow dependency on `SubmitDatasetMetadata`. This dependency has been unnecessary
  since the introduction of `SubmitDatasetMetadata` in v0.0.60. (`#151 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/151>`__)


v1.1.2 (2024-09-19)

v1.1.1 (2024-09-18)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Add validation in linearity_correction task to ensure that the value of NUM_FRAMES_IN_RAMP is the same
  across all frames in a ramp, and that the value of NUM_FRAMES_IN_RAMP actually matches the number of frames found. (`#147 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/147>`__)
- When writing linearized frames, use a fixed tag list as opposed to one derived from L0 data to alleviate load on redis. (`#148 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/148>`__)


v1.1.0 (2024-09-10)
===================

v0.0.80 (2024-08-15)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Use arm-specific Parsing tasks from v0.0.78 in local trial (AKA GROGU) workflows as well. (`#143 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/143>`__)
- Re-activate `CryonirspL0QualityMetrics` task in "l0_to_l1" local trial workflow. (`#143 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/143>`__)

v0.0.70 (2024-06-25)
====================

Features
--------

- Use ParameterMixin paradigm from `dkist-processing-common` to simplify the definitions of Parameter classes. Specifically, this
  means using the `ParameterWavelengthMixin` and `ParameterArmIdMixin` to provide support for parameters that depend on either wavelength
  or arm ID. This functionality had existed previously, but now it is achieved by using standard tools in `dkist-processing-common`. (`#134 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/134>`__)


Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-pac` to v3.0.2. No effect on `dkist-processing-cryonirsp`. (`#136 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/136>`__)


v0.0.69 (2024-06-12)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-fits-specifications` to v4.3.0. This version contains bugfixes for DL-NIRSP, but we want to say current. (`#133 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/133>`__)


v0.0.68 (2024-06-12)
====================

- Add CRYO-NIRSP arm ID to the L1 filename. (`#131 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/131>`__)


v0.0.65 (2024-06-04)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-data-simulator` to v5.2.0 and `dkist-inventory` to v1.4.0. These versions add support for DLNIRSP data (but it's nice to be up-to-date). (`#129 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/129>`__)


v0.0.64 (2024-06-03)

v0.0.52 (2024-04-02)
====================

Misc
----

- Update bad pixel correction method such that if more than a given fraction of the frame is impacted, a faster and more general algorithm is used. This reduces processing time in cases where the data has readout problems or other large scale issues. (`#109 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/109>`__)


v0.0.51 (2024-03-27)

- Correctly identify *partially* incomplete scan steps. Previously any scan step that had at least a single file was
  considered to exist in its entirety, even if some of its files were missing. (`#108 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/108>`__)


v0.0.48 (2024-03-15)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixes a bug in `ParseL0CryonirspLinearizedData` which conflated dark frames with the same exposure time but different OD filters. We need to be able to identify dark frame based on their exposure conditions (exposure time, Optical Density Filter) and use the exposure conditions to correlate the sets of dark frames with the frames sets they will be used to correct (lamp gain, solar gain, observe). (`#106 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/106>`__)


v0.0.47 (2024-03-15)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed a bug in `LinearityCorrection` that allowed an incomplete ramp to be linearized and passed onto the next processing stage. Incomplete ramps are now skipped and the parsing task will detect any incompleteness in the map and respond appropriately. (`#105 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/105>`__)


v0.0.46 (2024-03-13)
====================

  by the average Stokes-I data. (`#104 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/104>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- L1 CI Science frames now have array values that are given relative to value at disk center. Previously they had been raw counts per second.
  With this change the L1 CI frames have the same units as the L1 SP frames (i.e., counts/sec relative to disk center). (`#103 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/103>`__)


v0.0.45 (2024-03-06)
====================

Misc
----

- Add option to `l0_to_l1` local trial workflow to mimic running the `TransferCryoTrialData`. The command line option is `-X` and an optional argument can point
  to a specific place (anywhere in the filesystem) to save the trial outputs. If no argument to `-X` is specified then trial data will be saved in a directory called
  "trial_output" under the recipe run directory. (`#102 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/102>`__)

====================

Features
--------

- SP movie frames now show the 2D spectra for each L1 frame instead of stacked slit positions integrated over a wavelength range.
  This means that each spatial step now gets its own movie frame. It is expected that this is a temporary change. (`#91 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/91>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Movies now have the same aspect ratio as the L1 output frames. (`#91 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/91>`__)

  are both unbounded. (`#91 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/91>`__)


v0.0.32 (2024-02-08)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Improved accuracy of beam identification algorithm in `BeamBoundariesCalibration` by using a different algorithm to align the images. This also results in less data being discarded. (`#86 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp/pull-requests/86>`__)
