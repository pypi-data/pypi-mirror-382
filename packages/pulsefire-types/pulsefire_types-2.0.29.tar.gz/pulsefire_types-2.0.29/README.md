# Pulsefire
> **âš : This package contains schema typings only!**

Pulsefire is a modern and flexible Riot Games Python SDK. It was built to be simple to use, highly configurable, and extendable. Objects and client responses are fully typed to speed up coding efficiency. With support for community resources such as CDragon.

This package is a modern replacement of [Pyot](https://github.com/ianhco/Pyot). By comparison, code clarity has greatly improved and speed performance is more than 10x faster.

- Get Started: [Documentation](https://pulsefire.ianhco.dev)
- Consider starring this repository!

For developers who want to use pulsefire for typing purposes only, [alternative packages](https://pulsefire.ianhco.dev/usage/basic/installation/) containing only the `pulsefire.schemas` module are available in both python and typescript.
