A modern, high-performance Python library for tabular data processing with both in-memory and streaming capabilities.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Release notice ‚Äî Breaking changes in 2025.1.0
>
> The 2025.1.0 release introduces breaking changes to the exceptions and error codes raised by this library. Callers that depend on exact exception classes, message text, or literal error-code strings may need to update their code.
>
> Key changes:
>
> - Exceptions now carry structured metadata: an `error_code` (an `ErrorCode` enum) and an optional `context` dict.
> - Some error types were reorganized into more specific subclasses (for example, configuration-, column-, row-, and validation-related errors).
> - The textual formatting of some exception messages was stabilized to preserve backward compatibility where possible, but callers should prefer programmatic inspection of `error_code` and exception class.
>
> Migration:
>
> - Inspect raised exceptions for `error_code` (recommended) rather than parsing messages.
> - See `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` (ErrorCode section) and `CHANGELOG.md` for the full list of changed codes and examples.
>
> If you rely on the previous exception shapes or messages and need help migrating, open an issue or consult the API reference in `docs/` or the detailed migration guide: `docs/notes/MIGRATION-TO-2025.1.0.md`.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install splurge-tabular
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from splurge_tabular import TabularDataModel, StreamingTabularDataModel

# In-memory processing
data = [
    ["name", "age", "city"],
    ["Alice", "25", "New York"],
    ["Bob", "30", "London"]
]

model = TabularDataModel(data)
print(f"Columns: {model.column_names}")
print(f"Row count: {model.row_count}")

# Access data
for row in model:
    print(row)

# Streaming processing for large datasets
import io
csv_data = """name,age,city
Alice,25,New York
Bob,30,London"""

stream = io.StringIO(csv_data)
streaming_model = StreamingTabularDataModel(stream)
for row in streaming_model:
    print(row)
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies automatically managed via `pip`

## üß™ Testing

The library includes comprehensive test suites:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=splurge_tabular

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/        # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/ # Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/e2e/         # End-to-end tests
