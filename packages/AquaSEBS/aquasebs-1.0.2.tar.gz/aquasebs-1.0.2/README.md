**AquaSEBS** is a Python implementation of the Abdelrady et al. (2016) and Fisher et al. (2023) methodology for estimating water surface evaporation and energy balance components over freshwater and saline water bodies using satellite remote sensing data and meteorological inputs. The package implements the AquaSEBS (Aquatic Surface Energy Balance System) model, which combines Abdelrady et al.'s equilibrium temperature model for water heat flux with Fisher et al.'s adaptation for complete evaporation estimation using the Priestley-Taylor approach.

## Overview

This package implements the **Abdelrady et al. (2016) and Fisher et al. (2023) combined methodology** for physics-based estimation of:
- **Latent heat flux (evaporation)** using Priestley-Taylor equation (Fisher et al., 2023 adaptation)
- **Water heat flux** using equilibrium temperature model (Abdelrady et al., 2016)
- **Net radiation components** using Verma et al. method

The implementation follows the Abdelrady et al. (2016) formulations for water heat flux exactly, combined with Fisher et al. (2023) adaptations for complete evaporation estimation, accounting for the effects of water salinity on evaporation rates.

- **Salinity correction**: Implements Turk (1970) salinity reduction factor as specified in original methodology
- **Automated data retrieval**: Integrates with GEOS-5 FP and NASADEM for meteorological and topographic data
- **Flexible input handling**: Supports both raster and array data formats
- **Water masking**: Automatically identifies water bodies using NASADEM surface water body extent

## Scientific Background and Methodology

This package is a faithful Python implementation combining the **Abdelrady et al. (2016) water heat flux methodology** with the **Fisher et al. (2023) remote sensing evaporation approach**. Abdelrady et al. developed the equilibrium temperature model for water heat flux calculation, while Fisher et al. adapted and integrated this with the Priestley-Taylor equation for complete evaporation estimation from satellite data. The water heat flux equations, coefficients, and computational steps follow the original Abdelrady et al. (2016) publication exactly, while the overall evaporation framework follows Fisher et al. (2023).

### Theoretical Foundation

The surface energy balance for water bodies follows the fundamental equation:

$$R_n = LE + H + W \quad \text{(Eq. 1, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $R_n$ = Net radiation ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$) - total energy available at the water surface
- $LE$ = Latent heat flux ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$) - energy used for evaporation
- $H$ = Sensible heat flux ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$) - energy transferred to the atmosphere via convection
- $W$ = Water heat flux ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$) - energy stored in or released from the water body

### Water Heat Flux Calculation (Equilibrium Temperature Model)

The water heat flux is calculated using the equilibrium temperature model (ETM) as developed by **Abdelrady et al. (2016), Equations 8-13** and integrated into the complete evaporation framework by **Fisher et al. (2023)**. This approach, originally developed by Edinger et al. (1968) and adapted for remote sensing applications by Abdelrady et al., recognizes that there exists a theoretical equilibrium temperature where net heat exchange equals zero. Fisher et al. demonstrated how to combine this water heat flux calculation with Priestley-Taylor evapotranspiration for complete energy balance estimation. The implementation follows the exact formulations from both papers.

#### Step 1: Temperature Difference Calculation

$$T_n = 0.5 \times (WST - T_d) \quad \text{(Eq. 8, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $T_n$ = Temperature difference parameter ($\text{°C}$)
- $WST$ = Water surface temperature ($\text{°C}$) - measured from thermal infrared satellite data
- $T_d$ = Dew point temperature ($\text{°C}$) - temperature at which air becomes saturated

**Scientific Reasoning**: The temperature difference between water surface and dew point drives evaporation. The factor of 0.5 represents an empirical relationship that accounts for the non-linear response of evaporation to temperature gradients.

#### Step 2: Evaporation Efficiency

$$\eta = 0.35 + 0.015 \times WST + 0.0012 \times T_n^2 \quad \text{(Eq. 9, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $\eta$ = Evaporation efficiency (dimensionless)
- Where:
- $0.35$ = Baseline evaporation efficiency [dimensionless] - minimum efficiency under neutral conditions
- $0.015$ = Temperature dependence coefficient [$\text{°C}^{-1}$] - linear temperature sensitivity
- $0.0012$ = Non-linear temperature effect coefficient [$\text{°C}^{-2}$] - captures enhanced efficiency at high temperatures

**Scientific Reasoning**: Evaporation efficiency increases with water temperature and atmospheric stability. The baseline value represents minimum efficiency under neutral conditions, while the temperature terms account for enhanced molecular activity and vapor pressure differences at higher temperatures.

#### Step 3: Wind Speed Scaling

$$S = 3.3 \times u \quad \text{(Eq. 10, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $S$ = Scaled wind speed factor [dimensionless] - wind enhancement of evaporation
- $u$ = Wind speed at reference height [$\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}$] - typically measured at 2-10m above surface
- $3.3$ = Empirical scaling coefficient [$\text{s}\,\text{m}^{-1}$] - derived from field measurements over water bodies

**Scientific Reasoning**: Wind enhances evaporation by removing saturated air from the water surface and bringing in drier air. The scaling factor converts wind speed into an evaporation enhancement parameter based on field measurements over water bodies.

#### Step 4: Thermal Exchange Coefficient

$$\beta = 4.5 + 0.05 \times WST + (\eta + 0.47) \times S \quad \text{(Eq. 11, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $\beta$ = Thermal exchange coefficient [$\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\,\text{°C}^{-1}$] - overall heat transfer efficiency
- $4.5$ = Base thermal conductance [$\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\,\text{°C}^{-1}$] - minimum heat transfer under calm conditions
- $0.05$ = Temperature sensitivity coefficient [$\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\,\text{°C}^{-2}$] - enhanced transfer at higher temperatures
- $0.47$ = Wind enhancement baseline [dimensionless] - minimum wind effect on thermal exchange

**Scientific Reasoning**: The thermal exchange coefficient represents the efficiency of heat transfer between water and atmosphere. It increases with temperature (enhanced molecular motion) and wind (improved mixing), with the evaporation efficiency providing additional enhancement.

#### Step 5: Equilibrium Temperature

$$T_e = T_d + \frac{SW_{net}}{\beta} \quad \text{(Eq. 12, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $T_e$ = Equilibrium temperature ($\text{°C}$)
- $SW_{net}$ = Net shortwave radiation ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$) - solar energy absorbed by water surface

**Scientific Reasoning**: The equilibrium temperature represents the theoretical water surface temperature at which net heat exchange would be zero. It increases with available solar energy and decreases with thermal exchange efficiency.

#### Step 6: Water Heat Flux

$$W = \beta \times (T_e - WST) \quad \text{(Eq. 13, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

**Scientific Reasoning**: The water heat flux is proportional to the difference between equilibrium and actual water temperatures. Positive values indicate energy storage in the water body (warming), while negative values indicate energy release (cooling).

### Latent Heat Flux Calculation (Priestley-Taylor Method)

The latent heat flux is calculated using the Priestley-Taylor equation, which is well-suited for water surfaces where aerodynamic resistance is minimal:

$$LE = \alpha \times \frac{\Delta}{\Delta + \gamma} \times (R_n - W) \quad \text{(Priestley and Taylor, 1972)}$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ = Priestley-Taylor coefficient (1.26 for water surfaces)
- $\Delta$ = Slope of saturation vapor pressure curve ($\text{kPa}\,\text{°C}^{-1}$)
- $\gamma$ = Psychrometric constant ($0.066\,\text{kPa}\,\text{°C}^{-1}$)
- $\Delta/(\Delta + \gamma)$ = Energy partitioning factor

**Scientific Reasoning**: The Priestley-Taylor method assumes that evaporation from water surfaces is primarily energy-limited rather than aerodynamically limited. The coefficient α=1.26 accounts for the enhanced evaporation from free water surfaces compared to land surfaces.

### Net Radiation Calculation

Net radiation is calculated using the Verma et al. method when not provided directly:

$$R_n = SW_{in} \times (1 - \alpha_{surf}) + LW_{in} - LW_{out}$$

Where:
- $SW_{in}$ = Incoming shortwave radiation ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$)
- $\alpha_{surf}$ = Surface albedo (dimensionless)
- $LW_{in}$ = Incoming longwave radiation ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$)
- $LW_{out}$ = Outgoing longwave radiation ($\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$)

### Salinity Correction

For saline water bodies, evaporation is reduced according to Turk (1970):

$$\sigma = 1.025 - 0.0246 \times \exp(0.00879 \times S) \quad \text{(Eq. 19, Abdelrady et al., 2016)}$$

Where:
- $\sigma$ = Salinity reduction factor (dimensionless)
- $S$ = Water salinity ($\text{g}\,\text{L}^{-1}$)

**Scientific Reasoning**: Dissolved salts reduce vapor pressure according to Raoult's law, thereby decreasing evaporation rates. The exponential relationship captures the non-linear effect of increasing salinity concentrations.

- **Correlation (r²):** 0.71
- **RMSE:** 53.7 W/m² (38% of mean)
- **Bias:** -19.1 W/m² (13% of mean)
- **Sample size:** 686 cloud-free MODIS scenes

- **Bias:** -0.8 mm/day (26% of mean)

### Sensitivity Analysis

#### High Wind Event Impact
The methodology shows particular sensitivity to high wind events when evaporation shifts from radiatively-controlled to atmospherically-controlled:
- **Without wind filtering:** r² = 0.47, RMSE = 84.4 W/m² (62% of mean), Bias = -49.5 W/m² (36% of mean)
- **With wind filtering:** r² = 0.71, RMSE = 53.7 W/m² (38% of mean), Bias = -19.1 W/m² (13% of mean)

#### Error Predictors
Statistical analysis revealed key factors affecting model accuracy:
- **Wind speed:** Primary predictor of evaporation error (coefficient: 20.10, p < 0.001)
- **Relative humidity:** Secondary predictor (coefficient: -1.56, p < 0.001)
- **Wind direction:** Tertiary predictor (coefficient: 0.14, p = 0.02)

### Comparison with Previous Studies

**Historical validation results:**
- **Abdelrady et al. (2016):** RMSE 20-35 W/m², 1.5 mm/day (original development study)
- **Rodrigues & Costa (2021):** RMSE 0.81-1.25 mm/day, r² 0.51-0.65
- **This implementation:** RMSE 1.2-1.5 mm/day, r² 0.47-0.71

### Machine Learning Benchmark

Fisher et al. (2023) benchmarked AquaSEBS against 11 machine learning models to establish performance limits:
- **Top ML models:** Multilayer Perceptron, Elastic Net, LASSO, Ridge Regression, TensorFlow Neural Network
- **Result:** No machine learning model significantly outperformed AquaSEBS
- **Error prediction:** Neural networks achieved r² = 0.74 for predicting model errors
- **Conclusion:** Remaining errors likely due to measurement uncertainties, forcing data limitations, or scale mismatches rather than model formulation

### Operational Validation

**Current applications:**
- **NASA ECOSTRESS mission:** Operational production of open water evaporation over millions of water bodies
- **OpenET platform:** Core model for open water evaporation estimation in western United States
- **Spatial resolution:** Successfully validated from 30m (Landsat) to 1km (MODIS) scales

### Accuracy Summary

**Recommended accuracy expectations:**
- **Instantaneous estimates:** ±40-60 W/m² depending on wind conditions
- **Daily estimates:** ±1.2-1.5 mm/day with minimal bias
- **Optimal conditions:** Calm to moderate wind speeds (<7.5 m/s), clear sky conditions
- **Temperature sensitivity:** ±0.5°C water surface temperature accuracy required for reliable results
- **Spatial considerations:** Higher accuracy at 30m Landsat resolution compared to 1km MODIS

### Limitations and Considerations

**Known limitations:**
- **High wind sensitivity:** Reduced accuracy during high wind events (>7.5 m/s daily mean)
- **Scale mismatch:** Point measurements vs. pixel-scale estimates introduce uncertainty
- **Temporal mismatch:** Instantaneous satellite vs. daily/monthly ground measurements
- **Geographic gaps:** Limited validation in polar and high-altitude regions
- **Forcing data uncertainty:** Meteorological input uncertainties propagate through model

**Recommended applications:**
- **Water resource management:** Daily to seasonal evaporation estimates
- **Climate studies:** Long-term evaporation trends and patterns
- **Operational monitoring:** Real-time to near-real-time evaporation assessment
- **Scientific research:** Process understanding and water balance studies
