"""
GeomKit - A Python library for mathematical geometrical functionalities.

This library provides comprehensive geometric primitives and operations including:
- 2D and 3D points, vectors, and lines
- 2D shapes: circles, ellipses, polygons
- 3D shapes: spheres, cubes, rectangular prisms
- Transformation matrices (2D and 3D)
- BÃ©zier curves (quadratic and cubic)
- Bounding boxes (AABB)
- Geometric algorithms: convex hull, intersections
- Distance calculations and transformations
