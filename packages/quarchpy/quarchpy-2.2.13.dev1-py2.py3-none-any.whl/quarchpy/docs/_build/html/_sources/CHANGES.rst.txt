Changelog (Quarchpy)
====================
Quarchpy
--------
*QuarchPy is a python package designed to provide an easy-to-use API which will work seamlessly over any connection option: USB, Serial and LAN. With it, you can create your own scripts for controlling Quarch devices - without having to worry about the low-level code involved with communication.*

*The package contains all prerequisites needed as a single PyPI project, which can be installed from the python online repository using PIP. This makes it easy to install and update, while also providing you with full access to the source code if you want to make changes or additions.*

*QuarchPy can also communicate to the device via QIS (Quarch Instrument Server), QPS (Quarch Power Studio), or simply using Python scripts.  Both QIS and QPS are included with the QuarchPy Package - they are ready to use (Java and drivers may also be needed).*
