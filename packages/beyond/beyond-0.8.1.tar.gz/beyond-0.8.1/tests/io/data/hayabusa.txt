 BACKGROUND
  Hayabusa 2 is an asteroid sample return mission designed and operated by
  the Japanese space agency (JAXA). It was launched December 03, 2014 @ 04:22 
  UTC from the Tanegashima LA-Y site (Japan) using a H-IIA launch vehicle.

  After arrival at the target asteroid, 162173 Ryugu (1999 JU3), a separate 
  copper projectile will impact the surface at 2 km/s and create an 
  approximately 1-meter diameter crater, exposing the sub-surface material 
  which will then be sampled and returned to Earth.
