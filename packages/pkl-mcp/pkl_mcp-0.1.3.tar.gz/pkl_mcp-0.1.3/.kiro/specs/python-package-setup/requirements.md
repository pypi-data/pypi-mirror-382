# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a complete end-to-end development workflow for a Python PyPI package, from initial project setup through automated CI/CD deployment. The goal is to create a "hello world" foundation that demonstrates all essential components of modern Python package development, including local development environment, testing, linting, building, and automated GitHub workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want a properly structured PyPI package project, so that I can develop and distribute Python packages following industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a standard Python package directory structure
2. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a pyproject.toml file with proper package metadata
3. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a README.md with installation and usage instructions
4. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a LICENSE file
5. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL create a src/ directory with the main package module

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated dependency and environment management, so that I can work consistently across different machines and team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uv is used THEN the system SHALL create and manage virtual environments automatically
2. WHEN dependencies are defined THEN the system SHALL separate development and runtime dependencies
3. WHEN the environment is set up THEN the system SHALL install the package in editable mode for development
4. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL provide lock files for reproducible builds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive code quality tools, so that I can maintain high code standards and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL automatically format it using ruff
2. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run linting checks using ruff
3. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL perform type checking using mypy
4. WHEN pre-commit hooks are installed THEN the system SHALL run quality checks before each commit
5. WHEN quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent commits until issues are resolved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive testing framework, so that I can ensure code reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL use pytest as the testing framework
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute within the project's virtual environment
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports
4. WHEN tests are run locally THEN the system SHALL mirror the CI environment exactly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want local build validation, so that I can ensure code quality before pushing to the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local build is run THEN the system SHALL execute all quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
2. WHEN local build is run THEN the system SHALL run the complete test suite
3. WHEN local build is run THEN the system SHALL build the package distribution
4. WHEN local build fails THEN the system SHALL prevent pushing code to the repository
5. WHEN local build passes THEN the system SHALL confirm the code is ready for CI/CD

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated GitHub workflows, so that I can have continuous integration and deployment without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL automatically run CI checks on multiple Python versions
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run all quality and test checks
3. WHEN a release tag is created THEN the system SHALL automatically build and publish to PyPI
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN the system SHALL use the same tools and versions as local development
5. WHEN workflows fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until issues are resolved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub CLI integration, so that I can manage repository operations efficiently from the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use authenticated gh CLI commands
2. WHEN repositories are created THEN the system SHALL set them as private by default
3. WHEN pull requests are managed THEN the system SHALL use gh CLI for creation and review
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL verify gh auth status before operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want proper PyPI package configuration, so that users can easily install and use my package.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is built THEN the system SHALL create both wheel and source distributions
2. WHEN package metadata is defined THEN the system SHALL include proper version, description, and dependencies
3. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL upload to PyPI using secure authentication
4. WHEN users install the package THEN the system SHALL provide a simple pip install command
5. WHEN the package is imported THEN the system SHALL expose a clean public API
