        This is a generic class to find the "best" number of paths optimization problems implemented using `AbstractPathModelDAG`,
        and which are parameterized by the number of paths to be considered.
        The class iterates over a range of path numbers `k`, creating and  
        solving a model for each path number until one of the stopping conditions is met.
        
        Parameters
        ----------

        - `model_type : AbstractPathModelDAG`

            The type of the model used for optimization.

        - `stop_on_first_feasible : bool`, optional

            If True, the optimization process stops as soon as a feasible solution is found.
            Default is None.

        - `stop_on_delta_abs` : float, optional

            The threshold for change (in absolute value) in objective value between iterations to determine stopping the optimization.
            Default is `None`.

        - `stop_on_delta_rel` : float, optional

            The relative threshold for change (in absolute value) in objective value between iterations to determine stopping the optimization. 
            This is computed as the difference in objective value between iterations divided by the objective value of the previous iteration.
            Default is `None`.

            !!! warning "Pass at least one stopping criterion"
                At least one of the stopping criterion must be set: `stop_on_first_feasible`, `stop_on_delta_abs`, `stop_on_delta_rel`.

        - `min_num_paths : int`, optional

            Minimum number of paths to be considered in the optimization.
            Default is 1. The class will also call `get_lowerbound_k()` on the `model_type` and the provided arguments to get a better lower bound for the number of paths.

        - `max_num_paths : int`, optional
            
            Maximum number of paths to be computed.
            Default is `2**64`.

        - `time_limit : float`, optional
            
            Time limit (in seconds) for the optimization process.
            Default is `float("inf")`.

        - `**kwargs`

            The keyword arguments to be passed to the model. 

            !!! warning "Note"
                
                Do not pass the parameter `k` here, as it will be handled by the internal optimization process.

        Raises
        ------

        - `ValueError`

        Attempts to solve the optimization problem by iterating over a range of path counts, creating and
        solving a model for each count until one of the stopping conditions is met.
        The method iterates from the maximum between the minimum allowed paths and a lower bound (via
        `get_lowerbound_k()` of the model) to the maximum allowed paths. For each iteration:

        - Creates a model instance with the current number of paths (`k`).
        - Solves the model, and checks if it has been successfully solved.
        - Applies various stopping criteria including:

            - `stop_on_first_feasible`: stops at the first feasible solution.
            - `stop_on_delta_abs`: stops if the absolute change in the objective value between iterations is
                less than or equal to the `stop_on_delta_abs` value.
            - `stop_on_delta_rel`: stops if the relative change in the objective value between iterations is
                less than or equal to the `stop_on_delta_rel` value.

        - Stops if the elapsed time exceeds the designated time limit.

        Upon termination, the method sets the overall solve status:

        - If no feasible solution was found, the status is marked as infeasible.
        - If the process did not exceed the time limit but no other stopping condition was met, the status
            is marked as unbounded.
        - If any of the stopping criteria (feasible or delta conditions) were satisfied, the status is set as solved.

        If a valid solution is found, it stores the solution, updates solve statistics and the model,
        marks the problem as solved, and returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
