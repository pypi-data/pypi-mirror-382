# finattrib

**finattrib** is a Python library for capital attribution, RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) analysis, and profitability evaluation in financial risk management. It provides a modular and object-oriented framework to calculate, attribute, and visualize key risk metrics such as TCE (Tangible Common Equity) allocation, capital charge, return on capital, and RWA share.  

The library is designed for quant developers, risk managers, and financial analysts who want a flexible and extensible way to model portfolio risk and performance attribution at various aggregation levels (e.g., desk, product, portfolio).
