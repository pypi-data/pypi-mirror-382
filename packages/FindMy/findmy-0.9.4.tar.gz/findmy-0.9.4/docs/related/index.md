## Research / Proof of Concepts

#### [OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/)

_Author: [seemo-lab](https://github.com/seemo-lab)_

The original FindMy project that started it all. Seemo-lab originally used an Apple Mail plug-in to
obtain the authentication tokens necessary to request device locations.

OpenHaystack also includes scripts and firmware to turn devices such as the Micro:Bit and
generic Linux devices into DIY AirTags.

#### [FindMy](https://github.com/beimster/FindMy/)

_Author: [biemster](https://github.com/biemster)_

After [JJTech](https://github.com/JJTech0130/) discovered how to obtain the authentication tokens
without using a Mac, biemster published his "FindMy" project. It was one of the first scripts that was
able to query locations for DIY AirTags without needing access to a Mac.

Fun fact: FindMy.py originally started as an adoptation of biemster's FindMy, but refactored as a Python library.
Since then, FindMy.py has deviated from biemster's project somewhat. FindMy.py solely focuses on querying device locations
and has added support for local Bluetooth scanning and official AirTags, while biemster's FindMy mainly focuses on
DIY tags, and includes firmware for some embedded devices to turn them into AirTags.
