Note on security: the basic principle is "the more you expose, the more an attacker knows."
In this case, I think it should be fine, because all we expose here is stuff about mismatched hosts, and:

1. this will only happen while your site isn't properly configured yet
2. bugsink recommends a setup with a single host, so this info is literally knowable by looking at the URL bar
