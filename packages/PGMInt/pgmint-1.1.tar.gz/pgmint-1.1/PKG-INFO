This is a package primarily developed for neutron phase-grating moire interferometry simulations (PGMI, read: https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.023260), however it should serve well for any reasonably discretizable (again, see the paper previously mentioned) wave optics applications. 

Possible applications are mostly in interferometry (i.e., neutron, optical, and/or atom with modifications).
