    "text": "The prolific North Korean state-backed threat actor known as TA444 is back with shiny new malware for targeting macOS users, dubbed \"SpectralBlur.\" The custom tool is the latest in a string of proprietary malware that the advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been consistently generating \u2014 a trait that sets it apart from other DPRK-sponsored threats.According to Proofpoint threat researcher Greg Lesnewich, TA444 (aka APT38, BlueNoroff, BlackAlicanto, Coperenicum, Sapphire Sleet, and Stardust Chollima) debuted the SpectralBlur malware in August. It's a \"moderately capable backdoor, that can upload/download files, run a shell, update its configuration, delete files, hibernate, or sleep, based on commands issued from the [command-and-control server],\"",
