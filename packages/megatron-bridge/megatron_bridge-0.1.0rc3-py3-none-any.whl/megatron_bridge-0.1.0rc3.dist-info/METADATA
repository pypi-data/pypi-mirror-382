## Overview

Megatron Bridge is a PyTorch native library under [NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo) that leverages [megatron-core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) to provide state-of-the-art training throughput for top models. It enables researchers and community developers to do both pre and post training using a performant and scalable training loop, with features like model parallelisms and mixed precisions (FP8, BF16, FP4 etc.).  Megatron Bridge users can either leverage existing 🤗HuggingFace models or define their custom PyTorch model definitions for end-to-end workflows with flexibility.


## 🔧 Installation

### 🐳 NeMo-FW container

Best experience, highest performance and full feature support is guaranteed by the [NeMo Framework container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo/tags). Please fetch the most recent $TAG and run the following command to start a container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -w /workdir -v $(pwd):/workdir \
  --entrypoint bash \
  --gpus all \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:${TAG}
```

### 📦 Bare metal install with TransformerEngine

TransformerEngine is a required dependency for Megatron Bridge. To install on bare metal (without any container), the following system requirements need to be fulfilled:

- PyTorch >= 2.7
- CUDA >= 12.8
- cuDNN >= 9.3

We recommend installing the same versions that are present in the latest NGC PyTorch containers. The versions of these components for each container release can be found in the [PyTorch](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/index.html) and [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/cuda-dl-release-notes/index.html) container release notes.

Please see these [instructions](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads) for installing cuDNN for your target platform. You can check if CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are installed with:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep 'cuda-toolkit'
dpkg -l | grep 'cudnn.*cuda'
```

You can then run the following to install Megatron Bridge:

```bash
pip install torch setuptools pybind11 wheel_stub  # Required for TE
pip install --no-build-isolation megatron-bridge
```

### uv

For installing Megatron Bridge with uv, please refer to our [Contribution guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## ⚡ Quickstart

To get started, first install Megatron Bridge or download a NeMo Framework container as described [above](#-installation).

Log in to HuggingFace Hub:
```sh
huggingface-cli login --token <your token>
```

You can then run the following to import a model from HuggingFace and start training with mock data:
```python
from megatron.bridge import AutoBridge

import megatron.bridge.recipes.llama.llama32_1b as llama32_1b
from megatron.bridge.training.gpt_step import forward_step
from megatron.bridge.training.pretrain import pretrain

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load Llama from HuggingFace Hub and convert to Megatron
    bridge = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B")
    model_provider = bridge.to_megatron_provider()

    # Get defaults for other configuration from an existing Llama 3.2 recipe
    cfg = llama32_1b.pretrain_config()
    cfg.model = model_provider
    cfg.train.train_iters = 10

    cfg.dataset.sequence_length = cfg.model.seq_length
    cfg.tokenizer.vocab_size = cfg.model.vocab_size

    pretrain(cfg, forward_step)
```

You can launch the above script with:
```sh
torchrun --nproc-per-node=<num devices> /path/to/script.py
```

#### Launching Recipes

All recipes are ready to train out of the box, using mock data by default. For an example of how to override the default configuration through YAML or Hydra-style CLI overrides, please have a look at this [script](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/examples/recipes/llama/pretrain_llama3_8b.py). The script can then be launched with `torchrun`. For example, with the aforementioned script:

```sh
torchrun --nproc-per-node=2 pretrain_llama3_8b.py model.tensor_model_parallel_size=1 <additional overrides ...>
```

Optionally, Megatron Bridge also supports launching with [NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Run). See the following examples for reference on launching with NeMo-Run:

- [pretrain_llama3_8b_nemo_run_script.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/examples/recipes/llama/pretrain_llama3_8b_nemo_run_script.py)
- [pretrain_llama3_8b_nemo_run_partial.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/examples/recipes/llama/pretrain_llama3_8b_nemo_run_partial.py)

These examples can also be run as is with the Llama 3 8b recipe (with NeMo-Run installed).

Launch Llama 3 8b Pretraining with NeMo-Run's `run.Script`:

```sh
uv run python pretrain_llama3_8b_nemo_run_script.py \
    --nproc-per-node=2 \
    model.pipeline_model_parallel_size=1 \
    train.train_iters=10 # this script passes Hydra-style overrides to the target script
```

Launch Llama 3 8b Pretraining with NeMo-Run's `run.Partial`

```sh
uv run python pretrain_llama3_8b_nemo_run_partial.py \
    --nproc-per-node=2
```
