# Starting with schema version 8.0, there is a top-level field 'diaSourceId' in addition to 'diaSource.diaSourceId'.
# We're leaving this as [diaSource, diaSourceId] so that it still works for v<8 alerts.
# [FIXME] There is also a field called 'ssSource.diaSourceId'. Find out if it always has the same value as
# 'diaSource.diaSourceId' (unless null). If it has a different value, we need to figure out how to handle
# that in Alert.get() and Alert.get_key() so that we return 'ssSource.diaSourceId' for SS alerts.
