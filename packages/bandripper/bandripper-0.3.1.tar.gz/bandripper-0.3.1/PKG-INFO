# bandripper

Download albums from bandcamp using the command line.  
Only works for public tracks.  
Quality is limited to mp3 at 128 kbps.

## Installation

Install with:

```console
pip install bandripper
```

## Usage

##### Options

```console
> bandripper -h
Usage: bandripper [-h] [-n] [-o] [-nr] [str ...]

Positional Arguments:
  str                   The bandcamp url(s) for the album or artist. If the url is to an artists
                        main page, all albums will be downloaded. The tracks will be saved to a
                        subdirectory of your current directory. If a track can't be streamed (i.e.
                        private) it won't be downloaded. Multiple urls can be passed. (default: None)

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --no_track_number
                        By default the track number will be added to the front of the track title.
                        Pass this switch to disable the behavior. (default: False)
  -o, --overwrite       Pass this flag to overwrite existing files. Otherwise tracks that already
                        exist locally will not be downloaded. (default: False)
  -nr, --new_releases   Check urls in `discography_urls.txt` for new releases and download them. A
                        discography url is automatically added to the file when bandripper is used
                        on it. (default: False)
```
