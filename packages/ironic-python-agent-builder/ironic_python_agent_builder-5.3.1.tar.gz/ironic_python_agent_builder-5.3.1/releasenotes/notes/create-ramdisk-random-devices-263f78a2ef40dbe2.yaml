    Fixes issues with ramdisks potentially crashing when starting due to
    systemd attempting to access a random number generator before udevd has
    been launched. Depending on the mode of operation and underlying
    and configuration, i.e. in FIPS mode, the system could have crashed as
    a result. We will now always create the character devices devices, which
    can be used early in the boot sequence.
