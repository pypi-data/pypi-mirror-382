    On RHEL and CentOS 8 and later the *dhcp-all-interfaces* diskimage-builder
    element is now configured to only apply NetworkManager configuration by
    default. The *dhcp-all-interfaces* service will not be enabled.
    To re-enable the *dhcp-all-interfaces* service, set
    ``DIB_DHCP_NETWORK_MANAGER_AUTO=false`` in the environment.

    NetworkManager is quite capable to do automatic interface configuration.
    NetworkManager will by default try to auto-configure any interface with
    no configuration, it will use DHCP for IPv4 and Router Advertisements to
    decide how to initialize IPv6.
