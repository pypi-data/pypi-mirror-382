    Support for python2 in ironic-python-agent was dropped in the Ussuri release
    however it was still possible to build (non-functional) python2 images for
    CentOS 7. This python2 support is now dropped from the image build also. As
    part of this change, the `pip-and-virtualenv` element is not longer a
    dependency, so any custom elements which depend on this element will need to
    either include it explicitly or migrate to the recommended `ensure-venv`
    element.
