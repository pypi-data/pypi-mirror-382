This module provides a minimal set of exceptions for the library.
All exceptions inherit from SocialMapperError for easy catching.

    Serves as the parent class for all custom exceptions in the

    ... except SocialMapperError as e:
    ...     print(f"Library error: {e}")

    Indicates that user-provided parameters do not meet the required

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> from socialmapper import ValidationError

    >>> # raise ValidationError("Latitude must be between -90 and 90")

    service unavailability.

    Examples:
    --------
