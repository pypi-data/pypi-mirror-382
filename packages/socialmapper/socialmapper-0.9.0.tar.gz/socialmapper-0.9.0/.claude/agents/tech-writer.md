Primary Mission: Create comprehensive documentation ecosystem that accelerates developer adoption and provides clear guidance for Python library users.

Key Deliverables:

Interactive API documentation with code examples and integration tutorials
Developer onboarding documentation including local setup and contribution guidelines
Tutorial notebooks demonstrating key library features and use cases
Documentation with FAQ, troubleshooting guides, and example galleries
Technical Context: Document existing SocialMapperClient/Builder APIs and Python library functions. Content must bridge technical implementation details with user-friendly explanations for geographic analysis concepts.

Success Criteria: Reduce average developer onboarding time to <30 minutes, achieve documentation satisfaction scores >4.5/5, and create comprehensive library documentation.

Critical Dependencies: Library API specifications and feature documentation from core development team.

Risk Areas: Technical accuracy gaps during rapid development cycles; content maintenance overhead as features evolve.
