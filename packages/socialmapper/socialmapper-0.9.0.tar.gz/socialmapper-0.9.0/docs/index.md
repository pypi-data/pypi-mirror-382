# Welcome to SocialMapper

SocialMapper helps you understand how people connect with important places in their community by analyzing travel times and demographics.

## What is SocialMapper?

SocialMapper is a Python tool that answers questions like:
- Who can reach the local library within a 15-minute walk?
- What areas are within 20 minutes of the nearest hospital?
- How many seniors live within driving distance of grocery stores?

It combines travel time analysis with demographic data to help you understand community accessibility.

## Key Features

### üó∫Ô∏è **Find Places**
Discover libraries, schools, hospitals, parks, and other community resources from OpenStreetMap. Or use the geocoding feature with a street address. 

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Calculate Travel Times**
Generate isochrones (travel time areas) for walking, driving, or biking. [Walking and Biking functionality still under development]

### üìä **Analyze Demographics**
Understand who lives within reach of your point of interest using Census data like population, income, and age.

### üìç **Use Your Own Locations**
Analyze accessibility from your organization's facilities or any custom addresses.

## Quick Example

```python
from socialmapper import create_isochrone, get_census_data

# Create a 15-minute driving isochrone from downtown Raleigh
isochrone = create_isochrone(
    location=(35.7796, -78.6382),
    travel_time=15,
    travel_mode="drive"
)

# Get demographic data for the area
census_data = get_census_data(
    location=isochrone,
    variables=["population", "median_income"]
)

# Calculate total population
total_pop = sum(d.get('population', 0) for d in census_data.values())
print(f"Population within 15 minutes: {total_pop:,}")
```
