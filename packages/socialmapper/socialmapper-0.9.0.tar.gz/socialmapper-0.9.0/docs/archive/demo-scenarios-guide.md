### Key Insights You'll Discover
- 34% of Detroit residents live more than 1 mile from a grocery store
- Low-income neighborhoods have 40% less grocery access than affluent areas
- Public transit adds 25 minutes average to grocery trips
- 12 specific zones identified as severe food deserts

### Real-World Applications
- **Policy Making**: Inform healthy food financing initiatives
- **Business Planning**: Identify optimal locations for new grocery stores
- **Community Advocacy**: Document need for mobile markets or food co-ops
- **Public Health**: Link food access to health outcomes

### How to Interpret Results
- **Red zones** indicate areas where residents must travel >20 minutes for groceries
- **Population bubbles** show the number of affected residents
- **Income overlay** reveals correlation between poverty and food access

## üå≥ Scenario 4: Park Equity in Portland

### The Challenge
Portland prides itself on green spaces, but park access varies dramatically by neighborhood. This scenario reveals disparities in recreational space access.

### What This Demo Shows
- **10-Minute Walk**: Areas within walking distance of parks
- **Park Quality**: Access to parks with specific amenities
- **Green Space Per Capita**: Park acreage relative to population
- **Demographic Patterns**: Park access by race and income

### Key Insights You'll Discover
- 82% of residents are within 10-minute walk of a park
- East Portland has 70% less green space per capita
- Low-income areas have smaller, less-equipped parks
- 6 neighborhoods identified as "park deserts"

### Real-World Applications
- **Park Development**: Prioritize new park locations
- **Equity Funding**: Allocate resources to underserved areas
- **Community Planning**: Integrate green spaces in development
- **Health Initiatives**: Link park access to wellness programs

### How to Interpret Results
- **Green gradient** = park accessibility levels
- **Size of parks** shown proportionally on map
- **Amenity icons** indicate available facilities

## üöå Scenario 5: Transit Accessibility in Seattle

### The Challenge
Seattle's public transit system serves diverse communities with varying needs. This scenario analyzes how well transit connects residents to essential services.

### What This Demo Shows
- **Job Access**: Transit commute times to employment centers
