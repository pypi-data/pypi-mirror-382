## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Analysis Taking Too Long?**
- Large areas may take 2-3 minutes to process
- Try selecting a smaller area or fewer POI types
- Check your internet connection

**Map Not Loading?**
- Refresh your browser (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari recommended)

**Can't Find My Location?**
- Try entering a nearby landmark or intersection
- Use ZIP code or city name
- Click directly on the map

**Results Look Incorrect?**
- Verify your selected parameters
- Check the data source date (displayed in results)
- Consider time-of-day effects on travel times

### Data Accuracy and Limitations

**Data Sources**:
- OpenStreetMap for points of interest (updated weekly)
- US Census for demographics (2020 data with annual estimates)
- GTFS for transit data (updated monthly)

**Important Notes**:
- Travel times are estimates based on typical conditions
- POI data may not include all businesses
- Rural areas may have less complete data
- Results should be validated with local knowledge
