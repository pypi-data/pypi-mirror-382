## üí° Tips for Success

### Choosing Parameters
- **Start Conservative**: Use default parameters first, then experiment
- **Consider Context**: Urban areas need shorter travel times; rural areas need longer
- **Match Travel Mode to Population**: Walking for dense urban areas, driving for suburban/rural
- **Think About Use Case**: Emergency services need different parameters than recreational access

### Interpreting Results
- **Look for Patterns**: Are gaps clustered in certain neighborhoods?
- **Consider Demographics**: Do access gaps correlate with income, age, or race?
- **Examine Edge Cases**: What about areas with partial access?
- **Think Holistically**: One analysis rarely tells the complete story

### Using Findings
- **Document Methodology**: Note parameters used for reproducibility
- **Combine Multiple Analyses**: Run several scenarios to build comprehensive understanding
- **Validate Locally**: Check results against local knowledge
- **Present Clearly**: Focus on actionable insights, not technical details

## üîÑ From Demo to Custom Analysis

Once you're comfortable with demo scenarios, try creating custom analyses:

1. **Use Different Locations**: Apply the same analysis to your city/region
2. **Explore New POI Types**: Analyze childcare, pharmacies, job centers, etc.
3. **Combine Multiple Factors**: Layer different accessibility analyses
4. **Historical Comparison**: Run similar analyses over time to track changes
5. **Policy Scenario Testing**: Model impacts of proposed new facilities

The [Analysis Wizard](analysis-wizard.md) guide walks you through building custom studies from scratch.

## üìà Advanced Applications
