# üîç Nearby POI Discovery in SocialMapper

## Overview

The Nearby POI Discovery feature in SocialMapper revolutionizes how you explore Points of Interest (POIs) around any location. Instead of being limited to predefined datasets, this feature dynamically discovers what's actually accessible within realistic travel time constraints from any starting point.

Think of it as answering the question: "What can I actually reach from here in 20 minutes by walking?" - but for any location and any travel mode, with real-world routing and comprehensive categorization.

## What Makes This Feature Powerful

### üéØ Real-World Travel Constraints
- **Isochrone-based discovery** - POIs are found within actual travel time boundaries, not arbitrary circular buffers
- **Multi-modal routing** - Walking, biking, and driving with realistic travel speeds
- **Time-based filtering** - 1-120 minute travel time constraints

### üó∫Ô∏è Comprehensive POI Coverage
- **Live OpenStreetMap data** - Always up-to-date with the latest POI information
- **10 standardized categories** - Food & drink, healthcare, education, shopping, and more
- **338+ OSM tag mappings** - Comprehensive coverage of POI types
- **Intelligent categorization** - Automatic classification of discovered POIs

### üîß Flexible Analysis Options
- **Any starting location** - Address strings or coordinate pairs
- **Category filtering** - Include or exclude specific POI types
- **Result limiting** - Control the number of POIs per category
- **Rich export options** - CSV, GeoJSON, and interactive maps

## How It Works

The POI discovery feature follows a sophisticated 5-stage pipeline:

```
üìç Location ‚Üí üó∫Ô∏è Isochrone ‚Üí üîç POI Query ‚Üí üìä Processing ‚Üí üì§ Export
```

### Stage 1: Location Geocoding
Convert your starting location (address or coordinates) into precise geographic coordinates using multiple geocoding providers for reliability.

### Stage 2: Isochrone Generation  
Create realistic travel time boundaries using OpenRouteService routing engine, accounting for:
- Real road networks and walking paths
- Traffic patterns and routing restrictions
- Multi-modal travel (walk/bike/drive)

### Stage 3: POI Querying
Execute optimized Overpass API queries to discover all POIs within the isochrone boundary:
- Polygon-based spatial filtering for precision
- Category-specific tag filtering for relevance
- Efficient query optimization for large areas

### Stage 4: POI Processing
Transform raw OpenStreetMap data into organized, usable results:
- Automatic categorization using comprehensive tag mappings
- Distance calculations from origin point
- Address and contact information extraction
- Quality filtering and deduplication

### Stage 5: Results Export
Generate multiple output formats for different use cases:
- **CSV files** - For data analysis and spreadsheet work
- **GeoJSON files** - For GIS applications and mapping
- **Interactive maps** - For visual exploration and presentation

## Key Capabilities

### üè™ POI Categories

The system recognizes 10 major POI categories with 338+ specific mappings:

| Category | Examples | OSM Tags |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Food & Drink** | Restaurants, cafes, bars, bakeries | 47 mappings |
| **Shopping** | Supermarkets, clothing stores, malls | 89 mappings |
| **Healthcare** | Hospitals, clinics, pharmacies | 26 mappings |
| **Education** | Schools, libraries, universities | 16 mappings |
| **Transportation** | Bus stops, parking, fuel stations | 21 mappings |
| **Recreation** | Parks, gyms, cinemas, museums | 41 mappings |
| **Services** | Banks, post offices, government | 40 mappings |
| **Accommodation** | Hotels, hostels, camping | 12 mappings |
| **Religious** | Churches, mosques, temples | 14 mappings |
| **Utilities** | Restrooms, drinking water, ATMs | 16 mappings |

### üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Travel Modes

Support for three primary travel modes with realistic constraints:

- **Walking** - Pedestrian paths, sidewalks, crosswalks
- **Biking** - Bike lanes, bike-friendly roads, shared paths  
- **Driving** - Road networks, traffic restrictions, parking access

### üìä Rich Result Data

Each discovered POI includes comprehensive information:

**Core Data:**
- Name, category, and subcategory
- Precise coordinates and address
- Straight-line distance from origin
- OSM metadata (type, ID, tags)

**Enhanced Details** (when available):
- Contact information (phone, website)
- Opening hours
- Accessibility information
- User ratings and reviews

## Integration with SocialMapper

The POI discovery feature seamlessly integrates with SocialMapper's existing capabilities:

### üîó Workflow Integration
- **Census analysis** - Combine POI discovery with demographic analysis
- **Accessibility mapping** - Understand who can reach which resources
- **Multi-location analysis** - Compare POI accessibility across different areas
- **Temporal analysis** - Study changes in POI availability over time

### üõ†Ô∏è API Consistency
- **Builder pattern** - Fluent configuration API matching SocialMapper style
- **Result types** - Consistent error handling and success patterns
- **Export integration** - Unified output formats and directory structure
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time feedback during long-running operations

### üìà Advanced Use Cases

**Urban Planning:**
```python
# Analyze food desert areas
result = client.discover_nearby_pois(
    location="Low-income neighborhood",
    travel_time=15,
    travel_mode="walk", 
    poi_categories=["food_and_drink"]
)
```

**Healthcare Access:**
```python
# Study healthcare accessibility
result = client.discover_nearby_pois(
    location="Rural community center",
    travel_time=30,
    travel_mode="drive",
    poi_categories=["healthcare"]
)
```

**Transit Planning:**
```python
# Evaluate public transit connections
result = client.discover_nearby_pois(
    location=(lat, lon),
    travel_time=45,
    travel_mode="walk",
    poi_categories=["transportation"]
)
```
