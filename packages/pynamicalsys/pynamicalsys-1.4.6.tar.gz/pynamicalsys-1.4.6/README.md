## Overview

**pynamicalsys** is designed to provide a fast, flexible, and user-friendly environment for analyzing **nonlinear dynamical systems**. It is intended for students, researchers, educators, and enthusiasts who want to explore the world of chaos and dynamical systems. Beyond standard tools like trajectory generation and Lyapunov exponents calculation, **pynamicalsys** includes advanced features such as

- **Bifurcation diagrams**, **Poincaré sections**, and **stroboscopic maps** for analyzing system trajectories.
- **Symplectic integrators** for analyzing Hamiltonian systems.
- **Linear dependence index** for chaos detection.
- **Recurrence plots** and recurrence time statistics.
- Chaos indicators based on **weighted Birkhoff averages**.
- Statistical measures of **diffusion and transport** in dynamical systems.
- Computation of **periodic orbits**, their **stability** and their **manifolds**.
- Basin metric for **quantifying** the structure of **basins of attraction**.
- **Plot styling** for consistent and customizable visualizations.

**pynamicalsys** is built on top of NumPy and Numba, ensuring high performance and efficiency. Thanks to Numba accelerated computation, **pynamicalsys** offers speedups up to **130x** compared to the original Python implementation of the algorithms. This makes it suitable for large-scale simulations and analyses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install via PyPI

To install the latest stable release, run in your command line:

```bash
pip install pynamicalsys
```

> **Note:** On **Windows**, it is **strongly recommended** to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). It simplifies dependency management and avoids potential issues with scientific libraries during installation. Be sure to run the command from the **Anaconda Prompt**, not from Command Prompt or PowerShell, to ensure the correct environment is activated.

### Upgrade via PyPI

To upgrade your current version of **pynamicalsys** to the latest stable release, run in your command line:

```bash
pip install pynamicalsys --upgrade
```

### Install from source

If you want to install the development version from the source repository, clone the repo and install with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrolims/pynamicalsys.git
cd pynamicalsys
pip install .
```

### Verifying the installation

After installation, you can verify it by running Python and importing the package:

```python
>>> import pynamicalsys
>>> pynamicalsys.__version__
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure you have the latest version of pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip build
```
