### 3. Deployment Options

- Workers vs Pages vs other Cloudflare services?
- Cost analysis for our use case?
- Performance considerations?

### 4. AWS Comparison

- AWS Lambda/ECS/App Runner - Can they host FastMCP servers?
- Cost comparison: Cloudflare vs AWS for MCP hosting
- Performance & latency differences
- Which platform is better for our use case?
