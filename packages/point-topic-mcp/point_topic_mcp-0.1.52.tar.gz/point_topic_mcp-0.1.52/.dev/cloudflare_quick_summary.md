# Cloudflare Hosting Quick Summary

## 🚨 TL;DR: Python Workers Not Production Ready

**Bottom line**: Cloudflare Workers are AMAZING for MCP servers... but **Python packages don't work in production** (beta limitation).

## ✅ What's Great About Cloudflare

- **Native MCP support** with McpAgent class
- **50-80% cost savings** vs AWS Lambda
- **0ms cold starts** globally (vs 100-1000ms AWS)
- **Built-in OAuth** authentication
- **Global edge deployment** at 285+ locations
- **$5/month minimum** + usage-based pricing

## ❌ The Python Problem

- Python Workers in **beta only**
- **No packages in production** (FastAPI, FastMCP, etc.)
- Only **standard library** supported
- Our existing server **won't work**

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Migrate to TypeScript + McpAgent** (~2-3 weeks effort)

- Use Snowflake HTTP API instead of Python connector
- Keep existing Python server as backup
- Unlock all Cloudflare benefits

## 🚀 Alternative: AWS Lambda

- **Keeps Python** but costs 2x more
- **Slower performance** (cold starts)
- **More complexity** (OAuth setup)
- **Regional deployment** only
