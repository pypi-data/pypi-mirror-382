# PyPI Distribution Setup Complete ‚ú®

## What We've Accomplished

Your Python MCP server is now ready for the "super easy way" distribution! üéâ

### ‚úÖ PyPI-Ready Configuration

**Updated `pyproject.toml`**:
- Added proper entry point: `point-topic-mcp = "server_local:main"`
- Added metadata (description, author, license, keywords)
- Added build system configuration with hatchling

**Fixed Entry Point**:
- Added `main()` function in `server_local.py`
- Fixed import paths from old `prompts` to new `context` structure
- Added missing `__init__.py` files

**Updated README**:
- Added installation section for end users
- Clear MCP client configuration examples
- Publishing instructions for maintainers

### üöÄ How Users Will Install & Use

**Installation**:
```bash
pip install point-topic-mcp
```

**MCP Client Configuration** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "point-topic": {
      "command": "point-topic-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT": "their_account",
        "SNOWFLAKE_USER": "their_user",
        "SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD": "their_password",
        "SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE": "their_warehouse",
        "SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE": "their_database",
        "SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA": "their_schema"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### üì¶ Publishing Process

When ready to publish:

1. **Build**: `python -m build`
2. **Publish**: `twine upload dist/*` (or use the included `publish.sh` script)

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wizard's Notes

- **Python is perfectly fine** for MCP servers - many popular ones use it
- **stdio transport works beautifully** with Python
- **Environment variables for auth** = exactly how it should be done
- **Your approach is spot on** - this is the standard pattern

The mystical distribution spell has been cast! Your server can now be summoned by mere mortals with a simple `pip install` incantation. üîÆ
