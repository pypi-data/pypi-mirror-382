# HTTP Migration Plan - Conservative Approach

## What We Found

After researching the latest MCP SDK (v1.14.0), here's what's actually available:

### ✅ Current Capabilities
- **FastMCP** supports `streamable-http` transport
- **Built-in auth system** at `mcp.server.auth` 
- **User management system** already built and tested
- **All tools work unchanged** when switching transports

### ❌ What the Video Showed vs Reality
- Video showed FastMCP 2.0+ with built-in OAuth providers
- Current SDK doesn't have `GitHubOAuthProvider` or `GoogleOAuthProvider`
- OAuth integration needs to be implemented separately

## Conservative Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: HTTP Transport Only ✅
**Goal**: Get remote access working with existing user system

```python
# server_oauth.py - Your tools work exactly the same!
@mcp.tool()
def execute_query(sql_query: str) -> str:
    # Same exact function, just accessible over HTTP now
    return sf.execute_safe_query(sql_query)

# Run with HTTP transport instead of stdio
await mcp.run_streamable_http_async()
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Remote access works immediately
- ✅ All existing tools unchanged
- ✅ User system ready for OAuth integration
- ✅ Can test with curl/HTTP clients

### Phase 2: OAuth Integration (Next Step)
**Goal**: Add GitHub OAuth to HTTP server

Two approaches available:
1. **Official MCP SDK auth** - `mcp.server.auth` components
2. **Custom OAuth middleware** - GitHub API integration

### Phase 3: Production Ready
**Goal**: HTTPS, monitoring, deployment

## Your Tools Won't Change!

The beautiful thing: **your tools remain exactly the same**. Only the transport changes:

```python
# Before (stdio): uv run mcp dev server.py
# After (HTTP): python server_oauth.py
# Tools: IDENTICAL functionality, just accessible remotely
```

## Testing Plan

1. **Test HTTP transport locally** - `python server_oauth.py`
2. **Verify tools work via HTTP** - curl/web interface
3. **Add OAuth in phase 2** - GitHub login flow
4. **Deploy remotely** - cloud server + HTTPS

## GitHub OAuth Integration (Phase 2)

Since your email `peter.donaghey@point-topic.com` is in the YAML:

```yaml
# config/users.yaml
users:
  peter.donaghey@point-topic.com:  # This will work with GitHub OAuth
    access_level: full
```

When you sign in with GitHub, if your GitHub account uses that email, it'll automatically match your permissions. Perfect!

## Risk Mitigation

- **Small steps**: HTTP first, OAuth second  
- **Fallback ready**: Can always go back to stdio if needed
- **Testing focused**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Tools unchanged**: Zero risk to your core functionality

Ready to start with Phase 1 (HTTP transport only)?
