    Aggregate components into groups based on their power nodes.

    Aggregation steps (self._aggregate):
    1. Group components based on their power nodes (self._group_by_power_node):
    2. Aggregate grouped components into a single aggregated component for each group (self._aggregate_groups):
        - Max_capacity is calculated as the sum of the maximum capacity levels with weighted profiles.
        - Variable operational costs (voc) are aggregated using weighted averages based on the weighting method (now only max_capacity supported).
        - TODO: Add support for additional weighting methods (e.g. production instead of capacity).
        - Production is aggregated as the sum of production levels with weighted profiles. TODO: Add possibility to skip results aggregation.
    2a. Make new hydro module and delete original components from model data.
    3. Add mapping from detailed to aggregated components to self._aggregation_map.

    Disaggregation steps (self._disaggregate):

    Comments:
        - It is recommended to only use the same aggregator type once on the same components of a model. If you want to go from one aggregation level to
        another, it is better to use model.disaggregate first and then aggregate again. This is to keep the logic simple and avoid complex expressions.
        We have also logic that recognises if result expressions come from aggregations or disaggregations. When aggregating or disaggregating these,
        we can go back to the original results rather than setting up complex expressions that for examples aggregates the disaggregated results.
        - Levels and profiles are aggregated separately, and then combined into attributes.
        - We have chosen to eagerly evaluate weights for aggregation and disaggregation of levels and profiles. This is a balance between eagerly evaluating
        everything, and setting up complex expressions. Eagerly evaluating everything would require setting up new timevectors after eager evaluation, which
        is not ideal. While setting up complex expressions gives expressions that are harder to work with and slower to query from.
