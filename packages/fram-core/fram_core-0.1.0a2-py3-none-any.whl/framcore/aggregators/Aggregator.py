    Aggregator interface class.

    Public API is the aggregate and disaggregate methods.

    These methods come with the folloing calling rules:
    1. Not allowed to call aggregate twice. Must call disaggregate before aggregate can be called again.
    2. Disaggragate can only be called after aggregate has been called.

    Implementations should implement _aggregate and _disaggregate.
    - The general approach for aggregation is to group components, aggregated components in the same group, delete the detailed components,
    and add the mapping to self._aggregation_map.
    - The general approach for disaggregation is to restore the detailed components, move results from aggregated components to detailed components,
    and delete the aggregated components.
