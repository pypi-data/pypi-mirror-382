    This is a generalized function that creates a belief distribution based on
    the principle of maximum entropy. It assigns belief masses to events in a
    way that is as non-committal as possible, given the structure of the event
    space. The belief mass for each event is proportional to the size of its
    corresponding event space.

    Args:
        n (int): A size parameter passed to the `simple_generator`.
        simple_generator (function): A function that takes `n` and returns a
            simple space (a set of basic elements).
        event_generator (function): A function that takes the simple space and
            returns a set of all possible events.
        component_generator (function, optional): A function to create subsets
            of events. Defaults to `set`.
        condition_func (function, optional): A conditional function to apply
            to event generations. Defaults to `None`.

        Evidence: An `Evidence` instance representing the maximum entropy
                  distribution, where masses are normalized to sum to 1.
