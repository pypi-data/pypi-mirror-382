    """Combines two evidence objects using the Dempster-Shafer rule.

    This function applies the classic Dempster-Shafer (DS) rule of

    combines belief from two independent sources by intersecting their
    focal elements and multiplying their masses.

    A key feature of the DS rule is its handling of conflict. Any mass
    assigned to the empty set as a result of the combination is used to
    normalize the masses of the remaining non-empty sets.
