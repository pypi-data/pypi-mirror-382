    This function first finds all subsets of `simple_space` (similar to a
    powerset) and then generates all possible orderings (permutations) for
    each of these subsets. Each unique permutation is wrapped in an `Element`
    object.

        simple_space (set): The input set from which to generate permutations.

    Returns:
        set: A set of `Element` instances, where each instance contains a
             tuple representing a unique permutation.

    This function identifies elements that are common to both input tuples,
    `a` and `b`. It returns a list of tuples, where each inner tuple
    represents a valid sequence of indices corresponding to the common
    elements. The indices are determined by taking the maximum index for each
    common element from both tuples, and the final result is sorted based on
    these indices to maintain a combined ordering from both input sequences.

        a (tuple): The first ordered tuple.

              of an intersecting element from `a` and `b` respectively. The
              list is ordered based on the combined index values from both
