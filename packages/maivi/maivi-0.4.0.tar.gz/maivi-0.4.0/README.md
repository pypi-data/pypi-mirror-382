# Maivi - My AI Voice Input 🎤

**Real-time voice-to-text transcription with hotkey support**

Maivi (My AI Voice Input) is a cross-platform desktop application that turns your voice into text using state-of-the-art AI models. Simply press **Alt+Q** (Option+Q on macOS) to start recording, and press again to stop. Your transcription appears in real-time and is automatically copied to your clipboard.

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Hotkey Recording** - Toggle recording with Alt+Q (Option+Q on macOS)
- ⚡ **Real-time Transcription** - See text appear as you speak
- 📋 **Clipboard Integration** - Automatic copy to clipboard
- 🪟 **Floating Overlay** - Live transcription in a sleek overlay window
- 🔄 **Smart Chunk Merging** - Advanced overlap-based merging eliminates duplicates
- 💻 **CPU-Only** - No GPU required (though GPU acceleration is supported)
- 🌍 **High Accuracy** - Powered by NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B model (~6-9% WER)
- 🚀 **Fast** - ~0.36x RTF (processes 7s audio in 2.5s on CPU)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**CPU-only (Recommended - much faster, 100MB vs 2GB+):**
```bash
pip install maivi --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

**Or with GPU support (if you have NVIDIA GPU):**
```bash
pip install maivi --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

**Standard install (may download large CUDA files):**
```bash
pip install maivi
```

### System Requirements

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
```

**macOS:**
Grant Maivi microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring permissions the first time you run it (System Settings → Privacy & Security). No additional Homebrew packages are required for audio capture.

**Windows:**
- PortAudio is usually included with PyAudio

### Usage

**GUI Mode (Recommended):**
```bash
maivi
```

Press **Alt+Q** (Option+Q on macOS) to start recording, press **Alt+Q** again to stop. The transcription will appear in a floating overlay and be copied to your clipboard.

**CLI Mode:**
```bash
# Basic CLI
maivi-cli

# With live terminal UI
maia-cli --show-ui

# Custom parameters
maia-cli --window 10 --slide 5 --show-ui
```

**Controls:**
- **Alt+Q** (Option+Q on macOS) - Start/stop recording (toggle mode)
- **Esc** - Exit application

## 📖 How It Works

Maia uses a sophisticated streaming architecture:

1. **Sliding Window Recording** - Captures audio in overlapping 7-second chunks every 3 seconds
2. **Real-time Transcription** - Each chunk is transcribed by the NVIDIA Parakeet model
3. **Smart Merging** - Chunks are merged using overlap detection (4-second overlap)
4. **Live Updates** - The UI updates in real-time as transcription progresses

### Why Overlapping Chunks?

```
Chunk 1: "hello world how are you"
Chunk 2: "how are you doing today"
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          Overlap detected → merge!

Result: "hello world how are you doing today"
```

This approach ensures:
- ✅ No words cut mid-syllable
- ✅ Context preserved for better accuracy
- ✅ Seamless merging without duplicates
- ✅ Fast processing (no queue buildup)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Chunk Parameters

```bash
maia-cli --window 7.0 --slide 3.0 --delay 2.0
```

- `--window`: Chunk size in seconds (default: 7.0)
  - Larger = better quality, slower processing
- `--slide`: Slide interval in seconds (default: 3.0)
  - Smaller = more overlap, higher CPU usage
  - **Rule:** Must be > `window × 0.36` to avoid queue buildup
- `--delay`: Processing start delay in seconds (default: 2.0)

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Speed adjustment (experimental)
maia-cli --speed 1.5

# Custom UI width
maia-cli --show-ui --ui-width 50

# Disable pause detection
maia-cli --no-pause-breaks

# Stream to file (for voice commands)
maia-cli --output-file transcription.txt
```

## 📦 Building Executables

Maivi can be packaged as standalone executables for easy distribution:

```bash
# Install build dependencies
pip install maivi[build]

# Build executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed \
  --name maivi \
  --add-data "src/maia:maia" \
  src/maia/__main__.py
```

Pre-built executables are available in [Releases](https://github.com/MaximeRivest/maivi/releases).

## 🏗️ Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/MaximeRivest/maivi.git
cd maivi

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run tests
pytest
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No overlap found" warnings

This is **expected behavior** when there are long pauses (5+ seconds of silence). The system adds "..." gap markers to indicate the pause.

### Queue buildup (transcription continues after stopping)

Check that processing time < slide interval:
- Processing: `window_seconds × 0.36` (RTF)
- Should be < `slide_seconds`
- Default: `7 × 0.36 = 2.52s < 3s` ✅

### Model download issues

The first run downloads the NVIDIA Parakeet model (~600MB) from HuggingFace. If download fails:
- Check internet connection
- Verify HuggingFace is accessible
- Clear cache: `rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/`

### Qt/GUI crashes

If the GUI crashes on Linux:
```bash
# Check Qt installation
python -c "from PySide6 import QtWidgets; print('Qt OK')"

# Fall back to CLI mode
maia-cli --show-ui
```

## 📊 Performance

**Memory:**
- Model: ~2GB RAM
- Audio buffer: ~1MB
- Total: ~2.5GB RAM

**CPU:**
- Idle: <5% CPU
- Recording: 30-40% of 1 core
- Transcription: 100% of 1 core (during processing)

**Latency:**
- First transcription: 2s (start delay)
- Updates: Every 3s (slide interval)
- Completion: 1-3s after recording stops

**Accuracy:**
- Model WER: ~5-8%
- Overlap merging: <1% word loss
- Total effective WER: ~6-9%
