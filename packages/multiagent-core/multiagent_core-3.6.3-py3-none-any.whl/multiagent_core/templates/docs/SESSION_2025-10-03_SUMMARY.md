# Session Summary - October 3, 2025

**Session Duration**: Full day
**Focus**: E2E testing setup, workflow documentation, task layering principles

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ E2E Test Environment Setup
**Created**: `/tmp/multiagent-e2e-test/`

**Steps Completed**:
- Initialized Specify (`specify init --here --ai copilot`)
- Copied Orbit spec 001 as foundation (110 tasks - full Orbit SDK/CLI/MCP/API)
- Created second spec 002 (frontend dashboard - 42 tasks)
- Added frontend structure (package.json, src/, vite.config.ts)
- Ran `multiagent init` successfully
- Verified deployment of `.multiagent/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`

**Status**: ✅ Ready for workflow testing tomorrow

### 2. ✅ Workflow Order Documentation
**Created**: `.multiagent/README.md` workflow guide

**What We Documented**:
- Complete 5-phase workflow: Specify → MultiAgent → Setup → Development → Deployment
- Layered command execution (commands invoke other commands)
- Clear order for Phase 3 commands:
  1. `/docs:init`
  2. `/deployment:deploy-prepare 001`
  3. `/testing:test-generate 001`
  4. `/iterate:tasks 001`
- Agent workflow in Phase 4 (worktrees, parallel development)
- Pre-deployment checks in Phase 5

**Status**: ✅ Documented, needs validation through actual testing

### 3. ✅ Task Layering Principles Guide
**Created**: `.multiagent/core/docs/TASK_LAYERING_PRINCIPLES.md`

**What We Defined**:
- **Infrastructure First**: Models → Infrastructure → Adapters → Wrappers → Integration
- **Use Before Build**: Prefer battle-tested libraries over custom code
- **Critical Path Blocking**: Identify tasks that block entire layers
- **5-Layer Strategy**:
  - Layer 1: Foundation (models, protocols) - BLOCKS everything
  - Layer 2: Infrastructure (HTTP, retry, auth) - BLOCKS adapters
  - Layer 3: Adapters (business logic) - BLOCKS wrappers
  - Layer 4: Wrappers (MCP/CLI/API) - Can run in parallel
  - Layer 5: Integration & Polish
- **Use Before Build Decisions**: Document library choices per layer
- **Blocking Notes**: Explain why each layer must complete before next

**Status**: ✅ Comprehensive guide ready for `/iterate:tasks` implementation

### 4. ✅ Clarifying Questions Document
**Created**: `.multiagent/core/docs/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS.md`

**What We Captured**:
- 8 major question categories (40+ specific questions)
- Command system architecture questions
- Testing infrastructure strategy questions
- Deployment profile questions
- Specification handoff questions
- Production readiness criteria questions
- Scale and performance questions
- Documentation gaps
- Error handling and recovery questions

**Included**:
- 4-phase resolution strategy for tomorrow (7-11 hours estimated)
- Success criteria for v1.0
- Deferred features for v1.1+

**Status**: ✅ Ready to address systematically tomorrow

### 5. ✅ Global Claude Settings
**Created**: `/home/vanman2025/.claude/ide/settings.json`

**What We Enabled**:
- All current permissions from project settings
- Wildcards for ALL MultiAgent slash commands:
  - `SlashCommand(/core:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/docs:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/deployment:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/testing:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/iterate:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/github:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/supervisor:*)`
  - `SlashCommand(/planning:*)`
- Single source of truth for all MultiAgent projects
- No more per-project permission setup

**Status**: ✅ Ready to use in all future sessions

### 6. ✅ Local Development Optimization
**Completed**:
- Switched to editable install (`pipx install -e . --force`)
- Added `/tmp/` exclusion to prevent test project pollution
- Created `--backend-heavy` flag for minimal frontend scaffolding
- Moved dev-init script to correct location (`.multiagent/core/scripts/setup/`)

**Status**: ✅ Can iterate on templates instantly without rebuild

---

## Critical Discoveries

### ❌ `/core:project-setup` is Not Production-Ready
**Found**: 5+ `@claude` questions in the code
**Lines**:
- Line 8: "@claude are we not invoking a subagent to do this..."
- Line 45: "@claude don't we already have workflows as templates..."
- Line 90: "@claude look how the projects initialize git hooks..."
- Line 98: "@claude there is wholp process that needs to be run through here..."
- Line 113: "@claude not sure about this part either..."

**Impact**: Main orchestration command is incomplete
**Resolution**: Run individual commands manually (docs:init, deploy-prepare, test-generate, iterate:tasks) until fixed

### ⚠️ No Clear Workflow Order Until Today
**Problem**: No documentation existed showing command execution order
**Resolution**: Created comprehensive workflow guide in `.multiagent/README.md`
**Next**: Validate through actual E2E testing

### ⚠️ 110 Tasks Too Large for Testing
**Problem**: Orbit spec has 110 tasks - will blow through context
**Recommendation**: Reduce by 50-70% to ~30-40 tasks
**Purpose**: Just enough to test SDK → CLI → MCP → API flow

### ⚠️ Test Infrastructure Duplication
**Problem**: If `/testing:test-generate` creates tests from tasks.md, agents shouldn't
**Need**: Clear rule - "Test infrastructure creates tests, agents run them" OR vice versa
**Status**: Untested, needs validation

## Documentation Created/Updated

### New Documents
1. ✅ `.multiagent/core/docs/TASK_LAYERING_PRINCIPLES.md` (comprehensive guide)
2. ✅ `.multiagent/core/docs/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS.md` (40+ questions for tomorrow)
3. ✅ `/tmp/multiagent-e2e-test/docs/WORKFLOW_ORDER.md` (initial discovery - obsolete)
4. ✅ `docs/SESSION_2025-10-03_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Updated Documents
1. ✅ `.multiagent/README.md` - Added complete 5-phase workflow
2. ✅ `~/.claude/ide/settings.json` - Global permissions for all projects
3. ✅ `multiagent_core/cli.py` - Added `--backend-heavy` flag
4. ✅ `multiagent_core/auto_updater.py` - Added `/tmp/` exclusion

### Moved Documents
1. ✅ Moved `WORKTREE_BRANCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md` from `docs/architecture/` to `.multiagent/core/docs/agent-workflows/`
2. ✅ Moved `GIT_HOOKS_SYSTEM.md` from `docs/architecture/` to `.multiagent/core/docs/agent-workflows/`
3. ✅ Moved `dev-init` script from `scripts/` to `.multiagent/core/scripts/setup/dev-init.sh`

**Reason for Moves**: Deployed vs repo-only distinction
- `.multiagent/` = Deployed to projects (agents read)
- `docs/architecture/` = Repo-only (understanding multiagent-core)

---

## Tomorrow's Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (2-3 hours)
1. **Reduce Orbit spec** from 110 to ~30-40 tasks
   - Keep just enough to test full flow
   - One backend endpoint, one frontend component, one test
2. **Test each command individually**
   - `/docs:init` on reduced spec
   - `/deployment:deploy-prepare 001`
   - `/testing:test-generate 001`
   - `/iterate:tasks 001`
3. **Document what works vs broken**
4. **Fix or remove `/core:project-setup`**
   - Remove all `@claude` questions
   - Make it work or mark as "future enhancement"

### Phase 2: Validate Workflow (2-3 hours)
5. **Follow `.multiagent/README.md` step-by-step**
6. **Update README with actual reality**
7. **Document required vs optional commands**
8. **Create troubleshooting guide**

### Phase 3: Answer Architectural Questions (1-2 hours)
9. **Define test infrastructure strategy**
   - Test generation vs agent test creation
10. **Define task.md update strategy**
    - One-way vs bi-directional handoff
11. **Define production readiness criteria**
12. **Update documentation with decisions**

### Phase 4: Production Hardening (2-3 hours)
13. **Add error handling to critical commands**
14. **Create `/debug:doctor` health check command**
15. **Add command `--help` text**
16. **Test with second clean project**

**Total Estimated**: 7-11 hours of focused work

## What Works vs What Doesn't (Current State)

### ✅ Known Working
- `multiagent init` - Deploys structure successfully
- Editable install - Template changes instant
- Backend-heavy mode - Minimal scaffolding works
- Global settings - Full autonomy enabled
- Documentation structure - Clear organization

### ❓ Untested (Tomorrow's Focus)
- `/docs:init`
- `/deployment:deploy-prepare`
- `/testing:test-generate`
- `/iterate:tasks`
- `/supervisor:start/mid/end`
- `/github:pr-review`
- Agent worktree workflows

### ❌ Known Broken
- `/core:project-setup` - Has 5+ `@claude` questions, incomplete

### ⚠️ Unclear Status
- Command layering/orchestration
- Test infrastructure (generate vs agent-create)
- Task completion tracking (tasks.md vs layered-tasks.md)
- Agent coordination patterns

---

## Technical Debt Identified

1. **`/core:project-setup`** - Remove `@claude` questions, complete or scrap
2. **Command testing** - No E2E tests for slash commands
3. **Error handling** - Commands may fail silently
4. **Troubleshooting docs** - No guide for common issues
5. **Command help text** - No `--help` for most commands
6. **Health checks** - No `/debug:doctor` command to verify setup

## Final Notes

**The framework has solid bones but incomplete flesh.**

**Architecture is thoughtful**, but execution is half-finished. The fact that we had to reverse-engineer the workflow order today means it was never fully tested end-to-end.

**Tomorrow's work is about validation**, not building. We have enough infrastructure - now we need to:
1. Actually run it
2. Fix what breaks
3. Document what works

**We're close to v1.0**, but not there yet. The foundation is good - we just need to finish the implementation and validate it works.

**Estimated to v1.0**: 7-11 hours of focused work (if no major surprises)
