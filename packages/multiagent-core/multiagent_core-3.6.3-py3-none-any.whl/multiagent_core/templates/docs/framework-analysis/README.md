# Framework Analysis Documentation

This directory contains analysis reports and verification documents for the multiagent framework.

## Analysis Reports

### [pattern-verification.md](./pattern-verification.md)
Complete verification that the Universal Multiagent Pattern is working correctly across all subsystems.

**Pattern**: Command → Subagent → Script + Template → Operations

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ All 7 subsystems have proper scripts/ and templates/ infrastructure
- ✅ 73% of commands follow the Universal Pattern
- ✅ Pattern works identically for all systems
- ✅ `/iterate:tasks` serves as gold standard

### [overlap-analysis.md](./overlap-analysis.md)
Comprehensive analysis of all subagents, commands, and scripts to identify overlaps and redundancies.

**Key Findings**:
- 26 subagents analyzed
- 26 commands analyzed
- 88% confirmed unique (3 potential overlaps identified)
- Framework is well-organized with minimal redundancy

### [consolidation-recommendations.md](./consolidation-recommendations.md)
Detailed recommendations for consolidating redundant components.

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Deleted pr-feedback-router (unused)
- ✅ Archived testing-workflow (redundant with /testing:test)
- ✅ Archived test-comprehensive (legacy)
- Framework now has <1% redundancy

### [command-audit-report.md](./command-audit-report.md)
Audit of all slash commands to verify they follow proper subagent invocation patterns.

**Initial Findings**:
- 26 commands total
- 7/26 (27%) initially following pattern
- 19/26 (73%) after fixes

**Actions Taken**:
- Created 5 new subagents (supervisor-start/mid/end, pr-session-setup, pr-plan-generator)
- Fixed 9 commands to use Task(subagent-name) pattern

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
1. **Historical Record**: Track framework evolution and design decisions
2. **Quality Assurance**: Verify pattern consistency across subsystems
3. **Maintenance Guide**: Identify areas needing cleanup or improvement
4. **Onboarding**: Help new contributors understand framework architecture

## Generated

All analysis documents were generated on **2025-09-30** as part of framework quality review.
