        Implementation of a :class:`~org.orekit.rugged.raster.Tile` with a min/max kd tree.
    
        A n level min/max kd-tree contains sub-tiles merging individual cells together from coarse-grained (at level 0) to
        fine-grained (at level n-1). Level n-1, which is the deepest one, is computed from the raw cells by merging adjacent
        cells pairs columns (i.e. cells at indices (i, 2j) and (i, 2j+1) are merged together by computing and storing the
        minimum and maximum in a sub-tile. Level n-1 therefore has the same number of rows but half the number of columns of the
        raw tile, and its sub-tiles are 1 cell high and 2 cells wide. Level n-2 is computed from level n-1 by merging sub-tiles
        rows. Level n-2 therefore has half the number of rows and half the number of columns of the raw tile, and its sub-tiles
        are 2 cells high and 2 cells wide. Level n-3 is again computed by merging columns, level n-4 merging rows and so on. As
        depth decreases, the number of sub-tiles decreases and their size increase. Level 0 is reached when there is only either
        one row or one column of large sub-tiles.
    
        During the merging process, if at some stage there is an odd number of rows or columns, then the last sub-tile at next
        level will not be computed by merging two rows/columns from the current level, but instead computed by simply copying
        the last single row/column. The process is therefore well defined for any raw tile initial dimensions. A direct
        consequence is that the dimension of the sub-tiles in the last row or column may be smaller than the dimension of
        regular sub-tiles.
    
        If we consider for example a tall 107 â¨‰ 19 raw tile, the min/max kd-tree will have 9 levels:
