## Changelog

### 0.2.0

Simplified commands: `.asn` now handles ASNs, IPv4, and IPv6.

Using `bgp.tools` as backend instead of Team Cymru's DNS interface. Peer lookup
(`.asnp` command) is sadly no longer supported.

There is a new `.mac` command to look up the vendor ([OUI][nic-oui]) of hardware
MAC addresses, however.
