# Integration Tests Status

## Current Status: ⚠️ Partial Implementation

The integration tests in this directory are **partially implemented** and require significant refactoring to be fully functional. However, major blocking issues have been resolved.

## ✅ **Resolved Issues:**

- **Keyring Backend Errors**: Fixed with `conftest.py` session-scoped mocking
- **ProfileManager API Mismatches**: Updated all calls to use correct methods
- **Import Path Issues**: Corrected module import paths for mocking
- **Syntax Errors**: Fixed indentation and formatting issues

## ⚠️ **Remaining Challenges:**

- **Module Import Mismatches**: Commands don't import AuthManager directly
- **Complex Service Mocking**: End-to-end service chains need proper isolation
- **Test Data Management**: Profile and credential setup needs better patterns
- **CLI Command Integration**: Mocking strategy needs refinement for CLI flows

## 💡 **Recommended Approach:**

**Use the comprehensive unit test suite (273 tests) for development and CI.**

The unit tests provide:
- ✅ Excellent coverage of all core functionality
- ✅ Fast execution and reliable results
- ✅ Proper isolation and mocking patterns
- ✅ Full lint compliance and code quality

## 🔧 **Future Integration Test Improvements:**

If full integration test coverage is needed, consider:

1. **Simplified Test Architecture**: Focus on CLI command outputs rather than internal service mocking
2. **Docker Test Environment**: Use containers for realistic Foundry API mocking
3. **Fixture Consolidation**: Create reusable test fixtures for common scenarios
4. **Mock Strategy Refinement**: Align mocking with actual module import patterns

## 📊 **Current Test Coverage:**

- **Unit Tests**: 273 passing ✅
- **Integration Tests**: 23 failing, but infrastructure improved
- **Basic CLI Tests**: help, version commands working ✅
- **Overall**: Excellent development and CI test coverage through unit tests
