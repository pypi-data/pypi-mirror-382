              a CUDA-compatible GPU is recommended.
            - The model weights are loaded with torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 for
              efficiency on supported hardware.

                    - "y": a target column with the observed values.

            h (int):
                Forecast horizon specifying how many future steps to predict.

                Frequency of the time series (e.g. "D" for daily, "M" for
                monthly). See [Pandas frequency aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/
                pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases) for
                valid values. If not provided, the frequency will be inferred
                from the data.
            level (list[int | float], optional):
                Confidence levels for prediction intervals, expressed as
                percentages (e.g. [80, 95]). If provided, the returned
                DataFrame will include lower and upper interval columns for
                each specified level.
            quantiles (list[float], optional):
                List of quantiles to forecast, expressed as floats between 0
                and 1. Should not be used simultaneously with `level`. When
                provided, the output DataFrame will contain additional columns
                named in the format "model-q-{percentile}", where {percentile}
