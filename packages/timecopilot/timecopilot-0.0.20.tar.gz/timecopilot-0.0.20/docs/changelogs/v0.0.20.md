### Features

* **IBM's FlowState foundational model**: [FlowState](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm) has been added to the foundational models hub. FlowState is the first time-scale adjustable Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM), combining a State Space Model (SSM) Encoder with a Functional Basis Decoder for time-scale invariant forecasting. Refer to [#234](https://github.com/AzulGarza/timecopilot/pull/234) for more details.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from timecopilot.models.foundation.flowstate import FlowState

    df = pd.read_csv(
        "https://timecopilot.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/events_pageviews.csv",
        parse_dates=["ds"],
    )
    # Use the commercial model
    model = FlowState(repo_id="ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-flowstate-r1")
    # Or use the research model
    # model = FlowState(repo_id="ibm-research/flowstate")
    fcst = model.forecast(df, h=12)
    print(fcst)
    ```

### Fixes

* **TimesFM 2.5 integration**: Fixed compatibility issues with TimesFM 2.5 that were introduced in recent updates. The implementation now properly handles the new API changes in TimesFM 2.5. See [#235](https://github.com/AzulGarza/timecopilot/pull/235).

* **TimesFM loading from local path**: Fixed an issue where TimesFM models couldn't be loaded from local file paths. The model loading mechanism has been updated to properly handle both local and remote model sources. Thanks to @KilianZimmerer for the contribution! See [#230](https://github.com/AzulGarza/timecopilot/pull/230).
