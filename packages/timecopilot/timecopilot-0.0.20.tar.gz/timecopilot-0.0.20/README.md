## How It Works

TimeCopilot is a generative agent that applies a systematic forecasting approach using large language models (LLMs) to:

- Interpret statistical features and patterns
- Guide model selection based on data characteristics
- Explain technical decisions in natural language
- Answer domain-specific questions about forecasts

Here is an schematic of TimeCopilot's architecture:

## Quickstart in 30 sec

TimeCopilot can pull a public time series dataset directly from the web and forecast it in one command.  No local files, no Python script, just run it with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
# Baseline run (uses default model: openai:gpt-4o-mini)
uvx timecopilot forecast https://otexts.com/fpppy/data/AirPassengers.csv
```

Want to try a different LLâ€‹M?

```bash
uvx timecopilot forecast https://otexts.com/fpppy/data/AirPassengers.csv \
  --llm openai:gpt-4o
```

Have a specific question?

```bash
uvx timecopilot forecast https://otexts.com/fpppy/data/AirPassengers.csv \
  --llm openai:gpt-4o \
  --query "How many air passengers are expected in total in the next 12 months?"
```

## Installation and Setup

TimeCopilot is available on PyPI as [`timecopilot`](https://pypi.org/project/timecopilot/) for Python development. Installation and setup is a simple three-step process:

1. Install TimeCopilot by running:
  ```bash
  pip install timecopilot
  ```
  or 
  ```bash
  uv add timecopilot
  ```
2. Generate an OpenAI API Key:
    1. Create an [openai](https://auth.openai.com/log-in) account.
    2. Visit the [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) page.
    3. Generate a new secret key.  
    Make sure to copy it, as youâ€™ll need it in the next step. 

3. Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable by running:

   On Linux:
    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-new-secret-key"
    ```
   On Windows (PowerShell):
    ```
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-new-secret-key"
    ```
   Remember to restart session after doing so in order to preserve the changes in the environment variables (Windows).
   You can also do this through python:

   ```
   import openai
   os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-new-secret-key"
   ```
   
and that's it!

!!! Important
    - TimeCopilot requires Python 3.10+. Additionally, it currently does not support macOS running on Intel processors (x86_64). If youâ€™re using this setup, you may encounter installation issues with some dependencies like PyTorch. If you need support for this architecture, please create a new issue.
    - If on Windows, Python 3.10 is recommended due to some of the packages' current architecture.

## Hello World Example
Here is an example to test TimeCopilot:

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from timecopilot import TimeCopilot

# Load the dataset
# The DataFrame must include at least the following columns:
# - unique_id: Unique identifier for each time series (string)
# - ds: Date column (datetime format)
# - y: Target variable for forecasting (float format)
# The pandas frequency will be inferred from the ds column, if not provided.
# If the seasonality is not provided, it will be inferred based on the frequency. 
# If the horizon is not set, it will default to 2 times the inferred seasonality.
df = pd.read_csv("https://timecopilot.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/air_passengers.csv")

# Initialize the forecasting agent
# You can use any LLM by specifying the model parameter
tc = TimeCopilot(
    llm="openai:gpt-4o",
    retries=3,
)

# Generate forecast
# You can optionally specify the following parameters:
# - freq: The frequency of your data (e.g., 'D' for daily, 'M' for monthly)
# - h: The forecast horizon, which is the number of periods to predict
# - seasonality: The seasonal period of your data, which can be inferred if not provided
result = tc.forecast(df=df, freq="MS")

# The output contains:
# - tsfeatures_results: List of calculated time series features
# - tsfeatures_analysis: Natural language analysis of the features
# - selected_model: The best performing model chosen
# - model_details: Technical details about the selected model
# - cross_validation_results: Performance comparison of different models
# - model_comparison: Analysis of why certain models performed better/worse
# - is_better_than_seasonal_naive: Boolean indicating if model beats baseline
# - reason_for_selection: Explanation for model choice
# - forecast: List of future predictions with dates
# - forecast_analysis: Interpretation of the forecast results
# - user_query_response: Response to the user prompt, if any
print(result.output)

# You can also access the forecast results in the same shape of the
# provided input dataframe.  
print(result.fcst_df)

## Ask about the future

With TimeCopilot, you can ask questions about the forecast in natural language. The agent will analyze the data, generate forecasts, and provide detailed answers to your queries. 

Let's for example ask: **"how many air passengers are expected in the next 12 months?**"

```python
# Ask specific questions about the forecast
result = tc.forecast(
    df=df,
    freq="MS",
    query="how many air passengers are expected in the next 12 months?",
)

# The output will include:
# - All the standard forecast information
# - user_query_response: Detailed answer to your specific question
#   analyzing the forecast in the context of your query
print(result.output.user_query_response)

"""
The total expected air passengers for the next 12 months is approximately 5,919.
"""
```

You can ask other types of questions:

- **Trend analysis**:  
"What's the expected passenger growth rate?"
- **Seasonal patterns**:  
"Which months have peak passenger traffic?"
- **Specific periods**:  
"What's the passenger forecast for summer months?"
- **Comparative analysis**:  
"How does passenger volume compare to last year?"
- **Business insights**:  
"Should we increase aircraft capacity next quarter?"
