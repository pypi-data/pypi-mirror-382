This is the test suite for the `prefect-cloud` command library.

When generating test suites, favor generating a module of functional tests
rather than a class (unless the tests are already in a class).  Always add the
proper type hints to the _arguments_ of test and fixture functions, and to the
return values of fixtures, but don't add the `-> None` return value of every
test function.

When mocking the HTTP client, use `respx`.  Always set the filesystem to use a
`tmp_path` if files will be used in tests in order to avoid accidentally
modifying the files in the developer's home directory.

Stylistically, keep tests short and focused, and favor more smaller tests that share
some setup fixtures over longer tests.  Multiple assertions in one test are just fine,
as long as we're just testing roughly one thing.  Use the arrange-act-assert pattern,
but DO NOT add useless comments to that effect.  When generating tests, don't add any
comments that are unhelpfully just repeating what the code itself plainly says.  Always
generate docstrings for test functions that declare the behavior they are testing, in a
declarative form with should language like "`prefect cloud login` should set the active
profile".
