# ConMED-RL: An OCRL-Based Toolkit for Medical Decision Support

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/conmedrl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/conmedrl)

**ConMED-RL** is an **Offline Constrained Reinforcement Learning (OCRL)** toolkit designed for critical care decision support. The toolkit provides an OCRL-based policy learning framework for medical decision-making tasks under single or multiple constraints.

This toolkit builds upon our research on OCRL applications in critical care: a published study in *IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering* addressing ICU discharge decision-making, and ongoing work under revision in *Health Care Management Science* on ICU extubation decision-making.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install ConMED-RL using pip:

```bash
pip install conmedrl
```

### Brief Usage Instruction
- Set Hyparameter
```python
from ConMedRL import RLConfigurator, RLConfig_custom 

dm_configuration = RLConfigurator()
dm_configuration.choose_config_method()
dm_configuration.config.memory_capacity
```

- Load data into the training procedure (discharge decision-making case)

```python
from ConMedRL import FQE, FQI, TrainDataLoader, ValTestDataLoader

# Load your clinical data
train_data_loader = TrainDataLoader(cfg = dm_configuration.config, 
                                    outcome_table = outcome_table_train, 
                                    state_var_table = state_var_table, 
                                    terminal_state = terminal_state)

train_data_loader.data_buffer_train(action_name = 'discharge_action', 
                                    done_condition = True, 
                                    num_constraint = 2)

val_data_loader = ValTestDataLoader(cfg = dm_configuration.config, 
                                    outcome_table_select = outcome_table_val_select, 
                                    state_var_table_select = state_var_table_val_select, 
                                    outcome_table = outcome_table_val, 
                                    state_var_table = state_var_table_val, 
                                    terminal_state = terminal_state)

val_data_loader.data_buffer(action_name = 'discharge_action', 
                            done_condition = True, 
                            num_constraint = 2)
```

- Initialize the training of OCRL-based policy learning framework (discharge decision-making case)
```python
# Set the training of the model
ocrl_training = RLTraining(cfg = dm_configuration.config, 
                           state_dim = state_var_table.shape[1], 
                           action_dim = 2, 
                           train_data_loader = train_data_loader.data_torch_loader_train,
                           val_data_loader = val_data_loader.data_torch_loader)

# Building the FQI agent
fqi_agent = ocrl_training.fqi_agent_config(...) 

# Building the FQE agents
fqe_agent_obj = ocrl_training.fqe_agent_config(...) 

fqe_agent_con_0 = ocrl_training.fqe_agent_config(...) 

fqe_agent_con_1 = ocrl_training.fqe_agent_config(...) 

ocrl_training.train(agent_fqi = fqi_agent, 
                    agent_fqe_obj = fqe_agent_obj, 
                    agent_fqe_con_list = [fqe_agent_con_0, fqe_agent_con_1], 
                    constraint = True,
                    save_num = 100,
                    z_value = 1.96)
```

## üì¶ Core Components

### Offline Constrained Reinforcement Learning (OCRL) Algorithms

- **Fitted Q-Evaluation (FQE)**: Policy evaluation for offline data
- **Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI)**: Policy optimization 
- **Replay Buffer**: Efficient data management for training
- **Custom RL Configurator**: Flexible configuration for different clinical scenarios

### Data Processing

- **TrainDataLoader**: Handles training data preparation and batch generation
- **ValTestDataLoader**: Manages validation and testing data processing
- Support for custom done conditions and constraint cost functions

## üè• Key Features

- **Flexible Architecture**: Easy integration with existing clinical datasets
- **Medical Focus**: Specifically designed for critical care decision-making scenarios
- **Research-Backed**: Based on peer-reviewed methodologies

## üìä Use Cases

ConMED-RL has been successfully applied to:

- **ICU Discharge Decision-Making**: Optimizing timing and safety of patient discharge
- **ICU Mechanical Ventilation Weaning**: Supporting extubation decisions with constraint satisfaction
- **Multi-Constraint Clinical Decisions**: Balancing multiple clinical objectives requirements

## üîß Hyperparameter Configuration

```python
from ConMedRL import RLConfig_custom

custom_config = RLConfig_custom(
    algo_name = 'OCRL policy learning for ...'
    gamma = 0.99,
    batch_size = 256,
    train_eps = int(8e6),
    ...
)

# Use custom configuration in training
trainer = RLTraining(
    config = custom_config, 
    ...
)
```

## Data Preprocessing

ConMED-RL expects data in MDP format suitable for offline RL training:
- **State Table**: Physiological measurements and clinical variables
- **Outcome Table**: Actions, costs/rewards, and terminal indicators
