**ConMED-RL** is an **Offline Constrained Reinforcement Learning (OCRL)** toolkit designed for critical care decision support. The toolkit provides state-of-the-art algorithms for medical decision-making tasks, with a focus on ICU discharge and extubation decisions.

This toolkit is based on research published in *IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering* and is actively developed by researchers at TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install ConMED-RL using pip:

```bash
pip install conmedrl
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from ConMedRL import FQE, FQI, TrainDataLoader, ValTestDataLoader

# Load your clinical data
train_loader = TrainDataLoader(
    state_df=state_data,
    outcome_df=outcome_data,
    train_ids=train_patient_ids
)

# Initialize and train FQI agent
from ConMedRL import RLTraining

trainer = RLTraining(
    state_dim=state_dim,
    action_dim=action_dim,
    train_loader=train_loader
)

# Train the model
trainer.fqi_agent_train(epochs=100)

# Evaluate using FQE
fqe_results = trainer.fqe_agent_evaluate(test_loader)
```

## üì¶ Core Components

### Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

- **Fitted Q-Evaluation (FQE)**: Policy evaluation for offline data
- **Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI)**: Policy optimization with constraint handling
- **Replay Buffer**: Efficient data management for training
- **Custom RL Configurator**: Flexible configuration for different clinical scenarios

### Data Processing

- **TrainDataLoader**: Handles training data preparation and batch generation
- **ValTestDataLoader**: Manages validation and testing data processing
- Support for custom done conditions and constraint cost functions

## üè• Key Features

- **Offline Learning**: Train models on historical clinical data without online interaction
- **Constraint Handling**: Built-in support for clinical safety constraints
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easy integration with existing clinical datasets
- **Medical Focus**: Specifically designed for ICU decision-making scenarios
- **Research-Backed**: Based on peer-reviewed methodologies

## üìä Use Cases

ConMED-RL has been successfully applied to:

- **ICU Discharge Decision-Making**: Optimizing timing and safety of patient discharge
- **Mechanical Ventilation Weaning**: Supporting extubation decisions with constraint satisfaction
- **Multi-Constraint Clinical Decisions**: Balancing multiple clinical objectives and safety requirements

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Reward and Constraint Functions

```python
from ConMedRL import RLConfig_custom

config = RLConfig_custom(
    state_dim=50,
    action_dim=2,
    hidden_layers=[128, 128],
    learning_rate=0.001,
    gamma=0.99
)

# Use custom configuration in training
trainer = RLTraining(config=config, train_loader=train_loader)
```

### Data Preprocessing

ConMED-RL expects data in MDP format:
- **State Table**: Physiological measurements and clinical variables
- **Outcome Table**: Actions, rewards, and terminal indicators
