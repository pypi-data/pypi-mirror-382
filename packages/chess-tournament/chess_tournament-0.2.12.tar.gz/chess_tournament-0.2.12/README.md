## Overview

Chess Tournament Software is a standalone Python CLI application to manage players and tournaments in a chess club.
Data is stored in JSON files. The app is cross-platform and follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern.

## Installation (for users)

You’ll need **Python 3.8+** installed.
To avoid system-level issues (PEP 668, etc.), install the app in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install chess-tournament
```

---

## Usage

After installation, simply run:

```bash
chess
```
