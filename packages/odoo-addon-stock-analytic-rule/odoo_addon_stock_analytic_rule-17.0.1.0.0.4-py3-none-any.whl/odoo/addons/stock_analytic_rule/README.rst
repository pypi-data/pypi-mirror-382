This module extends the stock and analytic accounting capabilities by
automatically creating analytic lines from stock based on configurable
rules.

Key features:

- Define stock movement rules by source and destination locations.
- Compute analytic line amounts using either:

  - Product list price.
  - Category-based formula:
    ``(avg_price * (avg_weight * qty)) + ((avg_weight * qty) * supplement)``

- Support for positive and negative analytic distributions.
- Handles partial distributions and multi-account combinations.
- Supports return pickings and reversal analytic lines.
- Fully compatible with analytic plans and multidimensional analytic
  accounting.

The module is useful for organizations needing precise analytic
accounting for inventory movements, such as manufacturing, logistics, or
services.

Usage
=====

1. Configure Product Categories

Navigate to **Inventory > Configuration > Product Categories**.

For each relevant product category, configure the following fields:

- ``Average Price``: Base cost per unit.
- ``Average Weight``: Used to scale the cost relative to quantity.
- ``Supplement``: Additional surcharge applied on top of base cost.

These values are used when the compute type is set to **Category**.

--------------

2. Define Analytic Accounts and Plans

Navigate to **Accounting > Configuration > Analytic Accounting**.

- Create one or more **Analytic Plans**.
- Create **Analytic Accounts** linked to these plans.

These accounts will be referenced in the analytic distribution logic of
each model.

--------------

3. Create Stock Analytic Rules

Navigate to **Accounting > Configuration > Stock Analytic Rules**.

Configure each rule with:

- ``Name``: Used as the label for the generated analytic lines.
- ``Source Locations`` and ``Destination Locations``: Determines when
  the model applies.
- ``Amount Compute Type``: Choose between:

  - **Product** â€“ uses the product's list price.
  - **Category** â€“ uses the category's formula
    ``(avg_price Ã— weight Ã— qty) + (weight Ã— qty Ã— supplement)``.

- ``Analytic Distribution`` (for positive lines)
- ``Negative Analytic Distribution`` (for negative lines)
- ``Financial Account``: Used in the generated analytic line.

ðŸ“Œ **Note**: The distribution for reversed moves (e.g. returns) is
automatically computed by inverting the accounts â€” no need to define a
separate rule.

4. Perform a Stock Move

Create a Transfer that matches the configured rule:

- It can be internal, delivery, or receipt.

- Ensure the source and destination locations match the analytic rule.

5. Review Analytic Lines

Navigate to Accounting > Accounting > Analytic Lines.

You should now see the automatically generated analytic lines reflecting
the cost and distribution defined in your model.
