We also configure the maximum cycle and chain lengths for this KEP, and then solve our instance. We get returned both the solution, and the model used to find the solution. The solution contains the `selected` exchanges, which we can examine and print out. Printing an exchange will list the donor, recipient, and vertex ID for each vertex (pair) in the transplant. For instance, `V(D_13,R_12 (8))` is a pair containing donor 13, recipient 12, and the (internal) vertex ID is 8."
