# malcolm-test

`malcolm-test` serves to run an instance of [Malcolm](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/) and verify the results of system tests executed against it. It consists mostly of a [control script](#Usage), TOML files containing provisioning steps for virtual machine creation, and the test files themselves. See [this issue](https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm/issues/11) in the Malcolm repository for the discussion leading up to its creation.

## <a name="Installation"></a> Installation

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/malcolm-test)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/malcolm-test/)

Using `pip`, to install the latest [release from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/malcolm-test/):

```
python3 -m pip install -U malcolm-test
```

Or to install directly from GitHub:

```
python3 -m pip install -U 'git+https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm-Test'
```

This project makes use of:

* [virter](https://github.com/LINBIT/virter) for the creation and execution of libvirt-based virtual machines running Malcolm
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for the testing framework

pytest will be installed as a dependency by `pip`, but you will need to install and configure virter prior to running `malcolm-test`. See [its GitHub page](https://github.com/LINBIT/virter) for instructions.

Certain artifacts (e.g., PCAP files, Windows Event Log backup files, etc.) are required to run the test suite. These can be obtained by cloning [idaholab/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts](https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts) and passing the path of location of that working copy to `malcolm-test` with either the `-a/--artifacts-path` command-line argument or by setting the `MALCOLM_TEST_ARTIFACTS_PATH` environment variable. It is recommended to clone the Malcolm-Test-Artifacts repository with [`--depth 1`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt-code--depthcodeemltdepthgtem).

### <a name="UsageEnvironmentVars"></a> Environment Variables

When `--vm-provision-malcolm` is `true`, arguments to configure Malcolm can be provided via environment variables. These environment variables can be found in [01-clone-install.toml](src/maltest/virter/malcolm-init/01-clone-install.toml), though they must be prefixed with `MALCOLM_` to indicate their purpose. For example, setting the `MALCOLM_RUNTIME` environment variable to `podman` would cause Malcolm to be run with Podman instead of the default Docker backend. [02-auth_setup.toml](src/maltest/virter/malcolm-init/02-auth_setup.toml) similarly contains the environment variables for changing the virtual Malcolm instance's username and password from the default.

For settings which are not available as arguments to Malcolm's `install.py`/`configure` script, the special `MALCOLM_EXTRA` variable can be used to set values directly into the environment variable files. The format of this variable is:

`MALCOLM_EXTRA="filename.env:VARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_VALUE"`

More than one variable can be specified using a pipe character (`|`) as a delimiter. For example:

```bash 
MALCOLM_EXTRA="filebeat.env:FILEBEAT_PREPARE_PROCESS_COUNT=4|zeek-offline.env:ZEEK_AUTO_ANALYZE_PCAP_THREADS=4|suricata-offline.env:SURICATA_AUTO_ANALYZE_PCAP_THREADS=4" malcolm-test ...
```

### <a name="UsageExamples"></a> Examples

Here are some examples of use cases for `malcolm-test`. The output here is shown without verbose logging enabled; increasing the level of verbosity with `-v`, `-vv`, etc., can provide more information about the operations being performed.

#### <a name="FromScratch"></a> Provisioning a Malcolm VM and Running the Tests From Scratch

To provision the Malcolm VM from scratch, run the tests, then discard the VM:

```bash
$ malcolm-test --rm --artifacts-path /path/to/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts

Explanation of arguments:

* `--rm`: discard the VM after running the tests
* `--artifacts-path /path/to/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts`: specify the path to the upload artifacts used by the tests

#### <a name="BuildAndReuse"></a> Provisioning a Malcolm VM For Reuse With Subsequent Test Runs

Depending on the use case, because a complete from-scratch provisioning of the Malcolm VM can take a **long time** (due to installing packages, pulling Malcolm container images, waiting for startup, etc.), building a Malcolm image that can then be reused for multiple test runs may be useful. The steps to do this might look like this:

To build and provision a new Malcolm VM image and tag it as `malcolm-testing`:

```bash
$ malcolm-test --build-vm malcolm-testing
```

To run the tests using this already-provisioned VM image, then shut it down:

```bash
$ virter image ls
Name             Top Layer                                                                Created

====================== 39 passed in 4.26s ======================
```

Explanation of arguments:

* `--rm`: discard the VM after running the tests
* `--image malcolm-testing`: use the `malcolm-testing` image already built instead of building one from scratch
* `--vm-provision-os false`: since the image is already provisioned, skip VM provisioning steps
* `--artifacts-path /path/to/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts`: specify the path to the upload artifacts used by the tests

#### <a name="LongRunning"></a> Starting a Malcolm VM and Leaving It Running For Subsequent Test Runs

During test development, or in other instances where you wish to run the tests over and over again without bringing Malcolm up and down, this could be accomplished as described below.

In one shell session start a Malcolm VM using the already-provisioned image, keeping Malcolm running until interrupted, without running the tests:

```bash
$ malcolm-test \
    --stay-up \
    --rm \
    --image malcolm-testing \
    --vm-provision-os false \
    --run-tests false
```

Explanation of arguments:

* `--stay-up`: keep Malcolm up until interrupted (with CTRL+C or SIGKILL)
* `--rm`: discard the VM after shutting down
* `--image malcolm-testing`: use the `malcolm-testing` image already built instead of building one from scratch
* `--vm-provision-os false`: since the image is already provisioned, skip VM provisioning steps
* `--run-tests false`: don't run the tests with this instance of `malcolm-test`, just start Malcolm and wait

In another shell session, connecting to the existing running Malcolm instance for a test run:

```bash
$ virter vm ls
Name                  ID   Access Network  
malcolm-nearby-satyr  254  default   

$ malcolm-test \
  --rm false \
  --start false \
  --sleep 0 \
  --existing-vm malcolm-nearby-satyr \
  --vm-provision-os false \
  --vm-provision-malcolm false \
  --run-tests \
  --artifacts-path /path/to/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts

====================== 39 passed in 4.26s ======================
```

* `--rm false`: don't destroy the VM after running the tests (the other instance of `malcolm-test` will handle that)
* `--start false`: since Malcolm was already started by the other instance of `malcolm-test`, don't attempt to start it
* `--sleep 0`: since Malcolm was already started, there is no need to sleep before beginning test execution
* `--existing-vm malcolm-nearby-satyr`: specify the name of the existing running VM obtained by `virter vm ls`
* `--vm-provision-os false`: since the image is already provisioned, skip VM provisioning steps
* `--vm-provision-malcolm false`: since the Malcolm instance is already configured, skip Malcolm provisioning steps
* `--run-tests`: run the test suite
* `--artifacts-path /path/to/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts`: specify the path to the upload artifacts used by the tests

Repeat the previous command as many times as needed as you adjust your tests. When finished, return to the first shell session and press CTRL+C to terminate and discard the Malcolm VM.

### <a name="Cleanup"></a> Cleaning Up

If the `malcolm-test` script exits uncleanly for some reason and leaves orphaned running VMs, they can be cleaned up like this:

```bash
$ virter vm ls
Name                  ID   Access Network  
malcolm-nearby-satyr  254  default   

$ virter vm rm malcolm-nearby-satyr
```

To list and clean up any leftover Malcolm image tags:

```bash
$ virter image ls
Name            Top Layer                                                                Created

## <a name="PackageSource"></a> Source Code

Package source highlights (under [`./src/maltest`](src/maltest)):

* 🐍 [`maltest.py`](#Usage) - A Python script for running Malcolm in a VM with virter
* 🗁 `virter/` - A directory structure containing TOML files for [provisioning](https://github.com/LINBIT/virter/blob/master/doc/provisioning.md) the virter VMs in which Malcolm will run. Its subdirectories are arranged thusly:
    - 🗁 `debian-13/` - A directory matching the name of the virter image (supplied to `maltest.py`) with the `-i`/`--image` argument)
        + 🗁 `init/` - TOML files for the initial steps of provisioning the OS (before setting up and starting Malcolm)
        + 🗁 `fini/` - TOML files for the final stages of provisioning the OS (after shutting down Malcolm)
    - 🗁 `malcolm-init/` - Distribution-agnostic provisioning TOML files for setting up Malcolm prior to starting it
    - 🗁 `malcolm-fini/` - Distribution-agnostic provisioning TOML files for tearing down Malcolm after tests are complete
* 🗁 `tests/` - A directory structure containing the test definitions, built using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework

## <a name="TestCreation"></a> Creating Tests

`malcolm-test` uses the [`pytest` framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html). Please familiarize yourself with `pytest` as you begin developing new tests for the project.

New tests should be placed in the [`./src/maltest/tests/`](src/maltest/tests/) directory. Tests have access to the connection information for the running Malcolm instance through [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/fixtures.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files) provided by [`./src/maltest/tests/conftest.py`](src/maltest/tests/conftest.py).

Use `UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS` to specify artifact files required by your test. This example test would succeed if both `foobar.pcap` and `barbaz.pcap` were uploaded to Malcolm and their hashes stored in the global `artifact_hash_map`:

```python
import pytest

UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS = ['foobar.pcap', 'barbaz.pcap']

@pytest.mark.pcap
def test_malcolm_artifact_hash(
    artifact_hash_map,
):
    assert all([artifact_hash_map.get(x, None) for x in UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS])
```

As artifacts are uploaded to Malcolm by `malcolm-test`, they are [hashed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.shake_256) and stored in `artifact_hash_map` which maps the filename to its hash. The file is renamed to the hex-representation of the hash digest and the file extension (e.g., if the contents of `foobar.pcap` hashed to `52b92cdcec4af0e1`, the file would be uploaded as `52b92cdcec4af0e1.pcap`). This is done to ensure that conflicting filenames among different tests are resolved prior to processing. Since Malcolm automatically [assigns tags](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/upload.html#Tagging) to uploaded files, this hash should be used as a filter for the `tags` field for any network log-based queries for data related to that file. This way your tests can have reproducible outputs without being affected by artifacts for other tests.

By default, `malcolm-test` instructs Malcolm to skip [NetBox enrichment](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/upload.html#UploadNetBoxSite) for artifacts found in `UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS`. To make a test perform NetBox enrichment for its PCAP (using the Malcolm instance's default NetBox site), set `NETBOX_ENRICH` to `True` in the test source.

See the following tests for examples of how to access and use fixtures:

* [test_connectivity.py](src/maltest/tests/test_connectivity.py)
    - querying the [Malcolm API](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/api.html#API) using the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
    - querying the [data store](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/opensearch-instances.html#OpenSearchInstance) directly using the [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/python-low-level/) or [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html) client
* [test_common_protocols.py](src/maltest/tests/test_common_protocols.py)
    - querying the [Malcolm Field Aggregation API](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/api-aggregations.html), specifying a `from` query start time filter to search all historical data, a filter on `event.provider` to limit the result set to records from Zeek, and a `tags` filter to limit the matching records to the tags represented by the uploaded PCAPs (see above)

When creating tests for `malcolm-test`, it's recommended to use [custom markers](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html#working-with-custom-markers) to group like tests into categories. More than one marker can be used to decorate a test. Some example markers include (but are not limited to; be judicious in choosing custom markers):

* `@pytest.mark.arkime` - to indicate the test involves Arkime
* `@pytest.mark.beats` - to indicate the test involves data other than network log data (e.g., host logs, etc.)
* `@pytest.mark.carving` - to indicate the test involves Zeek file extraction ("carving")
* `@pytest.mark.dashboards` - to indicate the test involves OpenSearch Dashboards
* `@pytest.mark.hostlogs` - to indicate the test involves [third-party/host logs](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/third-party-logs.html#ThirdPartyLogs)
* `@pytest.mark.ics` - to indicate the test involves data or features related to OT/ICS network log data
* `@pytest.mark.mapi` - to indicate the test uses the [Malcolm API](https://idaholab.github.io/Malcolm/docs/api.html#API)
* `@pytest.mark.netbox` - to indicate the test relies on NetBox (see also `NETBOX_ENRICH` above)
* `@pytest.mark.opensearch` - to indicate the test uses the OpenSearch/Elasticsearch API directly
* `@pytest.mark.pcap` - to indicate the test relies on uploaded PCAP artifacts (see also `UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS` above)
* `@pytest.mark.vm` - to indicate the test deals with the Malcolm virtual machine itself
* `@pytest.mark.webui` - to indicate the test checks some web user interface component of Malcolm
* etc.

Using markers like this allows subsets of tests to be run, like in this example where only test with the `netbox` marker are selected:

```bash
$ malcolm-test \
  --rm false \
  --start false \
  --sleep 0 \
  --existing-vm malcolm-nearby-satyr \
  --vm-provision-os false \
  --vm-provision-malcolm false \
  --run-tests \
  --artifacts-path /path/to/Malcolm-Test-Artifacts \
