    \brief Routines for computing static structure factors.

    This computes the static structure factor S(k) between sets of points and
    query points. First, k-vectors are sampled isotropically, with each radial
    bin containing an equal density of k points. Next, the k-vectors are used to
    compute complex scattering amplitudes F(k) by summing over the scattering
    contribution of all particle positions (atomic form factors are assumed to
    be 1) at every k-vector. The complex conjugate of the scattering amplitudes
    of the points at each k-vector are multiplied by the scattering amplitudes
    of the query points at each k-vector. Finally, the results are binned
    according to their k-vector's magnitude and normalized by the number of
    samples in each radial bin in k-space.

    Note that k-vectors are in the physics convention, and q-vectors are in the
    crystallographic convention. These conventions differ by a factor of 2\pi.

    The methods in this class are based on algorithms in the MIT-licensed
    dynasor package available here:
