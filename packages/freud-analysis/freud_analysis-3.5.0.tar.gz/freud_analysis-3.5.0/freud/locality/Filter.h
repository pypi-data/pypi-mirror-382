/* Base class for all Neigborlist filtering methods in freud.
 *
 * A neighborlist filter is a class which is given a neighborlist and its goal
 * is to return a neighborlist with a number of bonds less than or equal to the
 * given neighborlist. Each filter will use information about the system to
 * determine which bonds need to be removed.
 *
 * After calling compute(), both the original Neighborlist and the new, filtered
 * neighborlist will be made available to users on the python side.
