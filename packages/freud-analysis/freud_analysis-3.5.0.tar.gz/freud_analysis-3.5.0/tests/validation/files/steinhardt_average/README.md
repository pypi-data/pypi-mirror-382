# Steinhardt Average Order Parameters Validation

Data files in this folder come from Robin van Damme and collaborators, with permission. Two reference codes ([this repository](https://github.com/ArvDee/Minkowski-structure-metrics-calculator/) and another implementation labeled "GC") were used to compute Steinhardt order parameters.
