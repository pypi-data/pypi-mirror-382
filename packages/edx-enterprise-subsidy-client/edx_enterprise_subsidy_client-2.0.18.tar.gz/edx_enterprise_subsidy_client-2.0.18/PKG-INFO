Purpose
*******

Client for interacting with the enterprise-subsidy service.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository into your ``[DEVSTACK]/src/`` folder
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/edx-enterprise-subsidy-client.git
  # Use a service container that would reasonably install this client, e.g.
  cd [DEVSTACK]/enterprise-subsidy && make app-shell
  cd /edx/src/edx-enterprise-subsidy-client

  # Set up a virtualenv in a ``venv/`` directory
  # You might need to install virtualenv first:
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get install -y virtualenv
  virtualenv venv/
  make requirements

  # Ensure things are looking ok by running tests
  make test

Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Use a service container that would reasonably install this client, e.g.
  cd [DEVSTACK]/enterprise-subsidy && make app-shell
  cd /edx/src/edx-enterprise-subsidy-client

  # Activate the virtualenv
  source venv/bin/activate

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit ...
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.
