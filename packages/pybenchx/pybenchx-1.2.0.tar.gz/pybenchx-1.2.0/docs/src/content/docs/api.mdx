## Quick map

| Area | What you get | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decorators & suites | `bench`, `Bench`, parameter grids, grouping | [Decorators & Suites](/api/decorators) |
| BenchContext & runner | Manual timing, calibration knobs, execution helpers | [BenchContext & Runner](/api/context) |
| Runs & storage | `Run` data model, `.pybenchx/` helpers, compare utilities | [Runs, Storage & Compare](/api/storage) |
| Reporters & exports | Table rendering, JSON/CSV/Markdown/Chart reporters, extending output | [Reporters & Exports](/api/reporters) |

## Module overview

- `pybench.bench_model`: dataclasses (`Case`, `Bench`, `bench`) powering the decorator workflow.
- `pybench.timing`: `BenchContext` plus the monotonic clock wrapper.
- `pybench.runner`: calibration/measurement engine used by the CLI and available for advanced integrations.
- `pybench.run_model`: serializable run outputs (`Run`, `VariantResult`, `StatSummary`).
- `pybench.run_store`: helpers for listing, loading, and pruning `.pybenchx/` history.
- `pybench.reporters`: output backends (ANSI table, Markdown, CSV, JSON, Chart.js).
- `pybench.utils` / `pybench.params`: supporting utilities (formatting, percentile math, parameter expansion).

Each module exports its public surface via `__all__`. If an object is not listed there, we consider it internal and subject to change.

## Import styles

```python
from pybench import bench, Bench, BenchContext
from pybench.runner import execute_case
from pybench.run_store import save_run, load_baseline
```

The package root intentionally re-exports only the decorator workflow. Reach into submodules when you need lower-level control (custom runners, storage automation, reporters).

## Versioning policy

pybenchx follows semver. Public APIs documented in this section remain stable within a major version. Expect additive changes (new parameters, dataclass fields) in minor releases; breaking changes only land in majors.
