We follow the Contributor Covenant 2.1.

- Repo: https://github.com/fullzer4/pybenchx
- Issues: https://github.com/fullzer4/pybenchx/issues

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo and install `uv` (or enable the provided Nix shell).
2. Create a virtual environment with `uv sync` or `uv pip install -e .[dev]`.
3. Run the full check suite before opening a PR:

	```bash
	ruff check .
	pytest
	```

`uv` pins dependencies in `uv.lock`; update both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` if you add packages. The Nix shell bundles Ruff, pytest, and Python toolchains for consistent CI parity.

## What makes a great contribution

- **Focused benchmarks** – new examples that illustrate profiling patterns or regression stories are welcome.
- **Reporters and storage** – extend output formats, add knobs to `run_store`, or improve `.pybenchx/` ergonomics.
- **Docs** – if something tripped you up, improve the page or add an FAQ entry. Small clarifications are incredibly helpful to new users.

Before implementing large features, open an issue so we can make sure it aligns with pybenchx’s scope (fast iteration, simple CLI, actionable reports).

## Running docs locally

The docs site is an Astro project. From `docs/` run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Bump MDX or content, then open http://localhost:4321 to preview changes. Use `npm run lint` for content checks when modifying multiple pages.

## Ground rules

- Follow the existing code style; we rely on Ruff for linting/formatting.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes—especially for CLI flags and reporters.
- Keep benchmarks deterministic: provide seedable data and avoid sleeping or network calls.

See the repo-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed development setup (Nix/uv), release checklist, and PR guidelines.
