If You provide feedback, suggestions, or improvements, You grant Qerent a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and exploit them without restriction. This License does not grant any right to use Qerent’s trade names, trademarks, logos, or domain names.

5. Third-Party Components
The Software may include or depend on third-party components provided under separate licenses. Those licenses govern the third-party components; this License governs the Qerent portions only. Required notices will be included with the distribution.

6. Support and Updates
Qerent has no obligation to provide updates, fixes, or support under this License. Qerent may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Software at any time without liability. Any support services, if available, are governed by a Primary Agreement or a separate support agreement.

16. Order of Precedence
This License governs Your use of the Software. If You have a Primary Agreement, that agreement controls **only to the extent it expressly supersedes this License with respect to the Software**. Otherwise, this License controls.

This License is the entire agreement for the Software and supersedes prior understandings on that subject. It may be modified only in a writing signed by Qerent. You may not assign this License without Qerent’s prior written consent; Qerent may assign it. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
