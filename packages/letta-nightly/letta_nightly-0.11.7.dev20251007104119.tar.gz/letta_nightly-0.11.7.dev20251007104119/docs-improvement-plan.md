#### Error Catalog Format
```markdown
### Error: `AgentCreationError: Invalid memory block`

**Symptom:**
```python
AgentCreationError: Memory block 'custom' is missing required 'description' field
```

**Cause:**
Custom memory blocks require a description field to help the agent understand when to use them.

**Solution:**
```python
memory_blocks=[
    {
        "label": "custom",
        "value": "Initial value",
        "description": "What this memory block stores"  # Add this
    }
]
```

Always include descriptions for custom blocks. Standard blocks (persona, human) auto-generate descriptions.
```
