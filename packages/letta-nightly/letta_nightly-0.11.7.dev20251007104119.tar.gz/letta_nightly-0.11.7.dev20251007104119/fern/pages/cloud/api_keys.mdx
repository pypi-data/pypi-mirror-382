## Using Your Own API Keys

Connect your own API keys for supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to Letta Cloud through the [models page](https://app.letta.com/models). When you have a custom API key (successfully) registered, you will see additional models listed in the ADE model dropdown.

### Selecting Your Custom Provider

After you connect your own OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini API key, make sure to select your custom provider in the ADE under "Your models".
For example, after connecting your own OpenAI API key, you will see multiple OpenAI models but with different providers ("Letta hosted" vs "Your models") - if you want to use your own OpenAI API key, you need to select the copy of the model associated with your custom provider.

### Billing and Quotas

Requests made using your custom API keys **do not count** towards your monthly request quotas or usage-based billing. Instead, you'll be billed directly by the provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) according to their pricing for your personal account.

Note that direct provider pricing will likely differ from Letta Cloud rates, and requests through your own API key may cost more than those made through Letta Cloud's managed services.
