Letta Cloud's observability tools help you monitor performance and debug issues. Each project you create in Letta Cloud has two main observability dashboards:

## [Monitoring](/guides/observability/monitoring)

<img className="dark" src="/images/observability_graph_dark.png" />

Track key metrics across four dashboards:
- **Overview**: Message count, API/tool errors, LLM/tool latency
- **Activity & Usage**: Usage patterns and resource consumption
- **Performance**: Response times and throughput
- **Errors**: Detailed error analysis and debugging info

## [Responses & Tracing](/guides/observability/responses)

Inspect API responses and agent execution:
- **API Responses**: List of all responses with duration and status
- **Message Inspection**: Click "Inspect Message" to see the full POST request and agent loop execution sequence
