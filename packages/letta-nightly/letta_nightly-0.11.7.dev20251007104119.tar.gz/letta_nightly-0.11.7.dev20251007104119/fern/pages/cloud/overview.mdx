Letta Cloud is our fully-managed service for stateful agents. While Letta can be self-hosted, Letta Cloud eliminates all infrastructure management, server optimization, and system administration so you can focus entirely on building agents.

## The fastest way to bring stateful agents to production

**Develop faster with any model and 24/7 agent uptime**: Access to OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini with high rate limits. Our platform automatically scales to meet demand and ensures 24/7 uptime of your agents. Your agents' state, memory, and conversation history are securely persisted.

**Features designed to help you scale to hundreds of agents**: Letta Cloud includes features designed for applications managing large numbers of agents: agent templates, template versioning, memory variables injected on agent creation, and advanced tooling for managing thousands of agents across many users.

## Model agnostic with zero provider lock-in

Your agent state is stored in a model-agnostic format, allowing you to easily migrate your agents (and their memories, message history, reasoning traces, tool execution traces, etc.) from one model provider to another.

Letta Cloud also supports [agent file](/guides/agents/agent-file), which allows you to move your agents freely between self-hosted instances of Letta and Letta Cloud.

You can upload local agents to Cloud by importing their `.af` files, and run Cloud agents locally by downloading and importing them into your self-hosted server.
