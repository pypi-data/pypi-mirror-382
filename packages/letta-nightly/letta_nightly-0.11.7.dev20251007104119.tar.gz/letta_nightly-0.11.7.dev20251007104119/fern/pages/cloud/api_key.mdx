## Access Letta Cloud

Letta Cloud is accessible via [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com).
If you have access to Letta Cloud, you can use the web platform to create API keys, and create, deploy, and monitor agents.

Even if you don't have access to Letta Cloud, you can still use the web platform to connect to your own self-hosted Letta deployments (found under the "Self-hosted" section in the left sidebar).

## Create a Letta Cloud API key

<Info>
You do not need a Letta Cloud API key to run Letta locally (it is only required to access our hosted service, Letta Cloud).
</Info>

To create an API, navigate to the [API keys section](https://app.letta.com/api-keys) in the dashboard (you must be logged in to access it).
Once on the page, you should be able to create new API keys, view existing keys, and delete old keys.
API keys are sensitive and should be stored in a safe location.

## Using your API key

Once you've created an API key, you can use it with any of the Letta SDKs or framework integrations.
For example, if you're using the Python or TypeScript (Node.js) SDK, you should set the `token` in the client to be your key (replace `LETTA_API_KEY` with your actual API key):
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript maxLines=50
import { LettaClient } from '@letta-ai/letta-client'
const client = new LettaClient({ token: "LETTA_API_KEY" });
```
```python title="python" maxLines=50
from letta_client import Letta
client = Letta(token="LETTA_API_KEY")
```
</CodeGroup>


If you're using the REST API directly, you can pass the API key in the header as a bearer token, e.g.

```bash
curl https://api.letta.com/v1/agents/ \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
