title: Workflows
subtitle: Workflows are systems that execute tool calls in a sequence
slug: guides/agents/architectures/workflows
---

Workflows execute predefined sequences of tool calls with LLM-driven decision making. Use the `workflow_agent` agent type for structured, sequential processes where you need deterministic execution paths.

Workflows are stateless by default but can branch and make decisions based on tool outputs and LLM reasoning.

## Agents vs Workflows

**Agents** are autonomous systems that decide what tools to call and when, based on goals and context.

**Workflows** are predefined sequences where the LLM follows structured paths (for example, start with tool A, then call either tool B or tool C), making decisions within defined branching points.

The definition between an *agent* and a *workflow* is not always clear and each can have various overlapping levels of autonomy: workflows can be made more autonomous by structuring the decision points to be highly general, and agents can be made more deterministic by adding tool rules to constrain their behavior.

## Workflows vs Tool Rules

An alternative to workflows is using autonomous agents (MemGPT, ReAct, Sleep-time) with [tool rules](/guides/agents/tool-rules) to constrain behavior.

**Use the workflow architecture when:**
* You have an existing workflow to implement in Letta (e.g., moving from n8n, LangGraph, or another workflow builder)
* You need strict sequential execution with minimal autonomy

**Use tool rules (on top of other agent architectures) when:**
* You want more autonomous behavior, but with certain guardrails
* Your task requires adaptive decision making (tool sequences are hard to predict)
* You want to have the flexibility (as a developer) to adapt the level of autonomy (for example, reducing constraints as the underlying LLMs improve)

## Creating Workflows

Workflows are created using the `workflow_agent` agent type.
By default, there are no constraints on the sequence of tool calls that can be made: to add constraints and build a "graph", you can use the `tool_rules` parameter to add tool rules to the agent.

For example, in the following code snippet, we are creating a workflow agent that can call the `web_search` tool, and then call either the `send_email` or `create_report` tool, based on the LLM's reasoning.
