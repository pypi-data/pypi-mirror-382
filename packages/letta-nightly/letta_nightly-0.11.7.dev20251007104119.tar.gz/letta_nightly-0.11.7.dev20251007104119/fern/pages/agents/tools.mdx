title: Connecting Agents to Tools
subtitle: Understand the different ways to use tools in Letta
slug: guides/agents/tools
---
Tools allow agents to take actions that affect the real world.
Letta agents can use tools to manage their own memory, send messages to users, search the web, and more.

You can add custom tools to Letta by defining your own tools, and also customize the execution environment of the tools.
You can import external tool libraries by connecting your Letta agents to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. MCP servers are a way to expose APIs to Letta agents.

## Where to get tools for your agents

There are three main ways to connect tools to your agents:
- [**Pre-built tools**](/guides/agents/prebuilt-tools): connect to tools that are built into the Letta server, such as memory management tools and web search / code execution.
- [**Custom tools**](/guides/agents/custom-tools): define your own tools in Letta using the SDK and the ADE.
- [**MCP servers**](/guides/mcp/overview): connect your agent to tools that run on external MCP servers.

Once a tool has been created (if it's a custom tool) or connected (if it's a pre-built tool or MCP server), you can add it to an agent by passing the tool name to the `tools` parameter in the agent creation:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript {9}
// create a new agent
const agent = await client.agents.create({
    memoryBlocks: [
        {label: "human", limit: 2000, value: "Name: Bob"},
        {label: "persona", limit: 2000, value: "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding: "openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    tools: ["my_custom_tool_name"]
});
```
```python Python {9}
# create a new agent
agent = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "human", "limit": 2000, "value": "Name: Bob"},
        {"label": "persona", "limit": 2000, "value": "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    tools=["my_custom_tool_name"]
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Tool Execution
You can customize the environment that your tool runs in (the Python package dependencies and environment variables) by setting a tool execution environment. See more [here](/guides/agents/tool-variables).

## Tool Environment Variables
You can set agent-scoped environment variables for your tools.
These environment variables will be accessible in the sandboxed environment that any of the agent tools are run in.

For example, if you define a custom tool that requires an API key to run (e.g. `EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY`), you can set the variable at time of agent creation by using the `tool_exec_environment_variables` parameter:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript {9-11}
// create an agent with no tools
const agent = await client.agents.create({
    memoryBlocks: [
        {label: "human", limit: 2000, value: "Name: Bob"},
        {label: "persona", limit: 2000, value: "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding: "openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    toolExecEnvironmentVariables: {
        "EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY": "banana"
    }
});
```
```python Python {9-11}
# create an agent with no tools
agent = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "human", "limit": 2000, "value": "Name: Bob"},
        {"label": "persona", "limit": 2000, "value": "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    tool_exec_environment_variables={
        "EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY": "banana"
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Tool Rules

Tool rules allow you to define graph-like constrains on your tools, such as requiring that a tool terminate agent execution or be followed by another tool.

Read more about tool rules [here](/guides/agents/tool-rules).

## External Tool Libraries

Letta supports connecting to external tool libraries via [MCP](/guides/mcp/overview).
You can connect to MCP servers via the Letta SDK (Python and TypeScript/Node.js) as well as via simple point-and-click in the ADE.
