Low-latency agents optimize for minimal response time by using a constrained context window and aggressive memory management. They're ideal for real-time applications like voice interfaces where latency matters more than context retention.

## Architecture

Low-latency agents use a **much smaller context window** than standard MemGPT agents, reducing the time-to-first-token at the cost of much more limited conversation history and memory block size. A sleep-time agent aggressively manages memory to keep only the most relevant information in context.

**Key differences from MemGPT v2:**
* Artificially constrained context window for faster response times
* More aggressive memory management with smaller memory blocks
* Optimized sleep-time agent tuned for minimal context size
* Prioritizes speed over comprehensive context retention

To learn more about how to use low-latency agents for voice applications, see our [Voice Agents guide](/guides/voice/overview).

## Creating Low-latency Agents

Use the `voice_convo_agent` agent type to create a low-latency agent.
Set `enable_sleeptime` to `true` to enable the sleep-time agent which will manage the memory state of the low-latency agent in the background.
Additionally, set `initial_message_sequence` to an empty array to start the conversation with no initial messages for a completely empty initial message buffer.

    memoryBlocks: [
        { value: "Name: ?", label: "human" },
        { value: "You are a helpful assistant.", label: "persona" },

    enableSleeptime: true,
    initialMessageSequence: [],
});
