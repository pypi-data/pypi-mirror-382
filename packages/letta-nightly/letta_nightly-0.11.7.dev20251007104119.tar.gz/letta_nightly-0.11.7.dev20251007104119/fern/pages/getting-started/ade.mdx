<Tip>
You run the ADE locally with [Letta Desktop](/quickstart/desktop), or via [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) where you can connect it to your own Letta Docker deployment. Read more about the ADE on our [blog post](https://www.letta.com/blog/introducing-the-agent-development-environment).

## What is the ADE?
The **Agent Development Environment (ADE)** is a visual interface for creating and managing stateful agents.
Use the ADE to design, test, and monitor your agents while getting direct visibility into their memory state and decision-making process.

Unlike simple chatbot interfaces, the ADE gives you complete control over your agent's state across its entire lifecycle:
- Create and customize agents without writing code
- Visualize your agent's memory and context window in real-time
- Add and test custom tools in a sandboxed environment
- Monitor agent behavior and performance

The ADE provides a graphical interface to agents running in your Letta server.
These same agents can be accessed via the [Letta APIs](/api-reference/overview), allowing you to integrate them into your applications.
