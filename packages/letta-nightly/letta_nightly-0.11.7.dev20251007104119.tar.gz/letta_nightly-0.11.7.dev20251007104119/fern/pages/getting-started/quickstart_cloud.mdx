slug: guides/cloud/quickstart

<Note>
Letta Cloud is currently in early access. Request early access [here](https://forms.letta.com/early-access).
</Note>

This quickstart will get guide you through creating your first Letta agent.
If you're interested in learning about Letta and how it works, [read more here](/letta-platform).

## Access Letta Cloud
Letta Cloud is accessible via [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com).
If you have access to Letta Cloud, you can use the web platform to create API keys, and create / deploy / monitor agents.

First, you need to [create a Letta Cloud API key](https://app.letta.com/api-keys).
For the rest of the quickstart, we'll assume your API key is `LETTA_API_KEY` - you should replace this with your actual API key.

## Projects

In Letta Cloud, your workspace is organized into projects.
When you create agents directly (instead of via [templates](/guides/templates/overview)), your agents will get placed in the "Default Project".

## Creating an agent with the Letta API
Let's create an agent via the Letta API, which we can then view in the ADE (you can also use the ADE to create agents).

To create an agent we'll send a POST request to the Letta server ([API docs](/api-reference/agents/create)).
In this example, we'll use `gpt-4o-mini` as the base LLM model, and `text-embedding-3-small` as the embedding model (this requires having configured both `OPENAI_API_KEY` on our Letta server).

We'll also artificially set the context window limit to 16k, instead of the 128k default for `gpt-4o-mini` (this can improve stability and performance):
<CodeGroup>
```curl curl
curl -X POST https://app.letta.com/v1/agents \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer LETTA_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "memory_blocks": [
    {
      "value": "The human'\''s name is Bob the Builder.",
      "label": "human"
    },
    {
      "value": "My name is Sam, the all-knowing sentient AI.",
      "label": "persona"
    }
  ],
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  "context_window_limit": 16000,
  "embedding": "openai/text-embedding-3-small"
}'
```
```python title="python" maxLines=50
# install letta_client with `pip install letta-client`
from letta_client import Letta

# create a client to connect to your local Letta server
client = Letta(
  token="LETTA_API_KEY"
)

# create an agent with two basic self-editing memory blocks
agent_state = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {
          "label": "human",
          "value": "The human's name is Bob the Builder."
        },
        {
          "label": "persona",
          "value": "My name is Sam, the all-knowing sentient AI."
        }
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    context_window_limit=16000,
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small"
)

# the AgentState object contains all the information about the agent
print(agent_state)
```
```typescript TypeScript maxLines=50
// install letta-client with `npm install @letta-ai/letta-client`
import { LettaClient } from '@letta-ai/letta-client'

// create a client to connect to your local Letta server
const client = new LettaClient({
  token: "LETTA_API_KEY"
});

// create an agent with two basic self-editing memory blocks
const agentState = await client.agents.create({
    memoryBlocks: [
        {
          label: "human",
          value: "The human's name is Bob the Builder."
        },
        {
          label: "persona",
          value: "My name is Sam, the all-knowing sentient AI."
        }
    ],
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    contextWindowLimit: 16000,
    embedding: "openai/text-embedding-3-small"
});

// the AgentState object contains all the information about the agent
console.log(agentState);
```
</CodeGroup>

The response will include information about the agent, including its `id`:
```json
{
  "id": "agent-43f8e098-1021-4545-9395-446f788d7389",
  "name": "damp-emerald-seahorse",
  ...
}
```

In Letta Cloud, your workspace is organized into projects.
When you create agents directly (instead of via [templates](/guides/templates/overview)), your agents will get placed in the "Default Project".
If we go into our "Default Project", we'll see the new agent we just created:
<img className="w-300" src="/images/letta_cloud_agents_list.png" />

## Send a message to the agent with the Letta API
<Tip>
The Letta API supports streaming both agent *steps* and streaming *tokens*.
For more information on streaming, see [our guide on streaming](/guides/agents/streaming).
</Tip>
Let's try sending a message to the new agent! Replace `AGENT_ID` with the actual agent ID we received in the agent state ([route documentation](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/agents/send-message)):
<CodeGroup>
```curl curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://app.letta.com/v1/agents/$AGENT_ID/messages \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer LETTA_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "hows it going????"
    }
  ]
}'
```
```python title="python" maxLines=50
# send a message to the agent
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent_state.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "hows it going????"
        }
    ]
)

# the response object contains the messages and usage statistics
print(response)

# if we want to print the usage stats
print(response.usage)

# if we want to print the messages
for message in response.messages:
    print(message)
```
```typescript TypeScript maxLines=50
// send a message to the agent
const response = await client.agents.messages.create(
    agentState.id, {
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: "hows it going????"
            }
        ]
    }
);

// the response object contains the messages and usage statistics
console.log(response);

// if we want to print the usage stats
console.log(response.usage)

// if we want to print the messages
for (const message of response.messages) {
    console.log(message);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The response contains the agent's full response to the message, which includes reasoning steps (inner thoughts / chain-of-thought), tool calls, tool responses, and agent messages (directed at the user):
```json maxLines=50
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "message-29d8d17e-7c50-4289-8d0e-2bab988aa01e",
      "date": "2024-12-12T17:05:56+00:00",
      "message_type": "reasoning_message",
      "reasoning": "User seems curious and casual. Time to engage!"
    },
    {
      "id": "message-29d8d17e-7c50-4289-8d0e-2bab988aa01e",
      "date": "2024-12-12T17:05:56+00:00",
      "message_type": "assistant_message",
      "content": "Hey there! I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How about you?"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 56,
    "prompt_tokens": 2030,
    "total_tokens": 2086,
    "step_count": 1
  }
}
```
You can read more about the response format from the message route [here](/guides/agents/overview#message-types).

## Viewing the agent in the ADE
We've created and messaged our first stateful agent.
This agent now exists in Letta Cloud, which means we can view it in the ADE (and continue the conversation there!).

If we click on "Open in ADE", we should see our agent in full detail, as well as the message that we sent to it:
<img className="w-300" src="/images/letta_cloud_agents_list.png" />

## Next steps

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You just created and messaged your first stateful agent with Letta, using both the Letta ADE, API, and Python/Typescript SDKs.

Now that you've succesfully created a basic agent with Letta, you're ready to start building more complex agents and AI applications.
