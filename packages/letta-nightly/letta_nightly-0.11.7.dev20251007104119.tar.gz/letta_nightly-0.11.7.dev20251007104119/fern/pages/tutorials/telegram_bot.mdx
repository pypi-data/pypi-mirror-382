The Letta Telegram Bot (@letta_ai_bot) lets you chat with your Letta agents directly through Telegram, bringing persistent memory and intelligent conversations to your favorite messaging app.

Communications with Letta agents using the Telegram bot will modify the agent's state everywhere that Letta agents are available -- for example, you will see the Telegram messages appear in Letta's ADE.

**New Features:**
- **Memory Management** - View and inspect your agent's memory blocks with `/blocks` and `/block`
- **Agent Templates** - Quick-start with preconfigured agents using `/template`
- **Reasoning Control** - Toggle agent thought visibility with `/reasoning enable/disable`
- **Proactive Notifications** - Allow agents to send you messages with `/telegram-notify`
- **Enhanced Navigation** - Comprehensive help system and quick reference commands

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Find the Bot

Open Telegram and search for **@letta_ai_bot** or visit [t.me/letta_ai_bot](https://t.me/letta_ai_bot) directly.

### Step 2: Start Your First Conversation

Send `/start` to the bot. You'll receive an interactive welcome with buttons to guide you through setup.

### Step 3: Connect Your Letta Account

You'll need a Letta API key to use the bot:

1. **Get Your API Key**:
   - Go to [app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com)
   - Sign in or create a free account
   - Navigate to Settings → API Keys
   - Create a new API key and copy it

2. **Login to the Bot**:
   ```
   /login sk-your-api-key-here
   ```
   The bot will immediately delete your message for security and confirm successful authentication.

### Step 4: Select an Agent

View your available agents:
```
/agents
```

Select an agent to chat with:
```
/agent agent-id-here
```

### Step 5: Start Chatting

Once you've selected an agent, just send any message to start your conversation.

## Understanding Your Agents

### What Are Letta Agents?

Letta agents are AI assistants with persistent memory. Unlike regular chatbots, they:
- **Remember Everything**: Your conversation history is preserved across sessions
- **Maintain Context**: They understand references to previous discussions
- **Use Tools**: Can search the web, run calculations, and more
- **Have Personalities**: Each agent can have unique traits and knowledge

### Managing Multiple Agents

You can create different agents for different purposes:
- **Personal Assistant**: General help and task management
- **Research Agent**: Specialized in finding and analyzing information
- **Creative Partner**: Focused on brainstorming and creative work
- **Study Buddy**: Helps with learning and retention

Switch between agents anytime with `/agent <id>` or use shortcuts for quick access.

[create Ion]
```

Simply tap the Ion button to instantly create and configure a new agent with advanced memory capabilities and adaptive personality.

### Ion's Advanced Memory System

Ion features a sophisticated 6-block memory architecture that enables deeper, more contextual conversations:

**Core Memory Blocks:**
1. **Persona**: Ion's adaptive personality that evolves to complement your communication style
2. **User Profile**: Dynamic profile that learns your preferences, interests, and patterns
3. **Memory Directives**: Guidelines for how Ion manages and updates its memory
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Tracks your communication preferences and response styles

```
User: What's the weather like in San Francisco today?
Agent: Let me search for current weather information... [searches web]
```

**View Available Tools**:
```
/tool
```

/shortcut personal agent-xyz789
```

**Use Shortcuts**:
```
/switch work
/switch personal
```

### Working with Projects

Organize your agents by project:

**List Projects**:
```
/projects
```

**Switch Projects**:
```
/project project-id-here
```

## Privacy and Security

### Your Data Is Protected

- **API Key Encryption**: Your API key is encrypted on the bot server with a unique key
- **Isolated Access**: You can only see your own agents and data
- **Secure Communication**: All messages are transmitted securely
- **Letta Cloud Storage**: Your conversations and agent data are stored on Letta Cloud and may be visible there

### Best Practices

1. **Protect Your API Key**: Never share it with others
2. **Use `/logout`**: Always logout on shared devices
3. **Regular Checks**: Use `/status` to verify your session
4. **Report Issues**: Contact support if you notice anything unusual

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

If the bot doesn't respond:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify you're logged in with `/status`
3. Try selecting an agent again with `/agent <id>`
4. Send `/help` to reset the conversation

### Authentication Issues

If you can't login:
1. Verify your API key at [app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com)
2. Make sure you're copying the entire key
3. Try generating a new API key
4. Use `/logout` first if you're having issues

### Agent Not Working

If your agent isn't responding properly:
1. Check that an agent is selected with `/agent`
2. Verify the agent exists with `/agents`
3. Try switching to another agent and back
4. Visit the ADE with `/ade` to check agent status

### Message Errors

If you see error messages:
- **"Authentication required"**: Use `/login` with your API key
- **"No agent selected"**: Choose an agent with `/agent <id>`
- **"Agent not found"**: The agent may have been deleted; use `/agents` to see available ones
- **"Timeout"**: Complex requests may take time; try again or simplify your request

## Common Use Cases

### Daily Planning
```
You: Good morning! What's on my schedule today?
Agent: Good morning! Based on our previous discussions, you have:
1. Team meeting at 10 AM about the Q4 roadmap
2. Lunch with Sarah to discuss the marketing campaign
3. Code review for the new feature at 3 PM
```

Agent: Based on the vibe you described (cozy, bookish, vintage), here are some suggestions...
```

## Practical Examples and Edge Cases

### Setting Up Multiple Agents for Different Purposes

**Scenario:** You want different agents for work and personal use.

```
# First, create shortcuts for easy switching
/shortcut work agent-abc123
/shortcut personal agent-xyz789

# During work hours
/switch work
"Can you review the quarterly report I mentioned yesterday?"

# After work
/switch personal
"What ingredients did we decide on for the dinner party?"
```

### Handling Authentication Issues

**Edge Case:** Your API key expires or becomes invalid.

```
You: Hello, are you there?
Bot: Authentication error

Your stored credentials appear to be invalid.
Please try /logout then /login <new_api_key>

# Solution:
/logout
/login sk-new-api-key-here
```

### Managing Tools for Specific Tasks

**Scenario:** You need web search for a research project.

```
# Check current tools interactively
/tool

# Select "attach new tools" button
# Navigate to web_search and select it
# Or use direct command:
/tool attach web_search

You: What are the latest developments in quantum computing?
Agent: Let me search for recent information... [uses web_search tool]
```

### Working with Large Agent Lists

**Edge Case:** You have many agents and can't remember IDs.

```
# Use shortcuts for frequently used agents
/shortcut main agent-abc123def456

# Search projects if agents are organized by project
/projects research
/project project-research-001
/agents

# Use descriptive shortcut names
/shortcut research-quantum agent-qnt789
/shortcut research-climate agent-clm456
```

### Recovering from Errors

**Scenario:** Bot stops responding mid-conversation.

```
# First, check your status
/status

# If authenticated, check agent selection
/agent

# If no agent selected, reselect
/agents
/agent agent-abc123

# If issues persist, refresh credentials
/logout
/login sk-your-api-key
```

### Switching Context Quickly

**Scenario:** Multiple ongoing projects with different agents.

```
# Morning standup prep
/switch work
"Summarize yesterday's progress on the API integration"

# Client meeting
/switch client-project
"What were the three main concerns from our last meeting?"

# Personal reminder
/switch personal
"What time did I say I'd pick up the kids?"
```

### Tool Conflicts and Resolution

**Edge Case:** Multiple tools with similar names.

```
/tool attach search

Bot: (ambiguous tool name)

multiple tools match 'search':
• web_search - search the internet
• doc_search - search documents
• code_search - search codebases

try being more specific

# Solution:
/tool attach web_search
```

### Memory Continuity Across Sessions

**Example:** Continuing a complex discussion.

```
# Monday
You: Let's plan the product launch for next month
Agent: I'll help you plan the launch. Let's start with...

# Wednesday
You: Where did we leave off with the launch plan?
Agent: On Monday, we outlined the timeline and identified three key milestones...
```

### Handling Network Issues

**Edge Case:** Slow or interrupted connections.

```
You: [Sends message]
[No response for 30 seconds]

# Bot will show typing indicator if processing
# If timeout occurs:
Bot: (please wait)

that took longer than expected. the query might be complex - try breaking it into smaller parts
```

### Project and Agent Coordination

**Scenario:** Organizing agents across multiple projects.

```
# View all projects
/projects

# Switch to development project
/project project-dev-123

# See dev-specific agents
/agents

# Create shortcuts for cross-project access
/shortcut dev-backend agent-backend-456
/shortcut dev-frontend agent-frontend-789
```
