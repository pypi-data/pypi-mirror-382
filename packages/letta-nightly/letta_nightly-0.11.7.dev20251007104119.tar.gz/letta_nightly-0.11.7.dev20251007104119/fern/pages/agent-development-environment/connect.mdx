title: Connecting to the ADE

<Tip>
The cloud/web ADE is avilable at [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com), and can connect to your Letta server running on `localhost`, as well as self-hosted deployments.

If you would like to run Letta completely locally (both the server and ADE), you can also use [Letta Desktop](/quickstart/desktop) instead (currently in alpha).

The ADE can connect to self-hosted Letta servers (e.g. a Letta server running on your laptop), as well as the Letta Cloud service.
When connected to a self-hosted / private server, the ADE uses the Letta REST API to communicate with your server.

## Connecting to a local server
To connect the ADE with your local Letta server (running on `localhost`), simply:
1. Start your Letta server (`docker run ...`)
2. Visit [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) and you will see "Local server" as an option in the left panel

## Connecting to an external (self-hosted) server
<Warning>
The cloud/web ADE does **not support** connecting to `http` (non-`https`) IP addresses, *except* for `localhost`.

For example, if your server is running on a home address like `http://192.168.1.10:8283`, the ADE (when running on a browser on another device on the network) will not be able to connect to your server because it is not on `https`.

For more information on `https` proxies, see [this page](/guides/server/remote).
</Warning>
If your Letta server isn't running on `localhost` (for example, you deployed it on an external service like EC2):
1. Click "Add remote server"
2. Enter your desired server name, the IP address of the server, and the server password (if set, otherwise leave empty)

Note that the remote IP address **must be `https`**, or the ADE will not be able to connect.
