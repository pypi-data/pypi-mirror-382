## Issues connecting to the ADE

### Recommended browsers
We recommend using Google Chrome to access the ADE.

### Ad-blockers
Ad-blockers may cause issues with allowing the ADE to access your local Letta server.
If you are having issues connecting your server to the ADE, try disabling your ad-blocker.

### <Icon icon="brands brave" /> Brave
Please disable Brave Shields to access your ADE.

### <Icon icon="brands safari" /> Safari
Safari has specific restrictions to accessing `localhost`, and must always serve content via `https`.
Follow the steps below to be able to access the ADE on Safari:
1. Install `mkcert` ([installation instructions](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))
2. Run `mkcert -install`
3. Update to Letta version `0.6.3` or greater
4. Add `LOCAL_HTTPS=true` to your Letta environment variables
5. Restart your Letta Docker container
6. Access the ADE at [https://app.letta.com/development-servers/local/dashboard](https://app.letta.com/development-servers/local/dashboard)
7. Click "Add remote server" and enter `https://localhost:8283` as the URL, leave password blank unless you have secured your ADE with a password.
