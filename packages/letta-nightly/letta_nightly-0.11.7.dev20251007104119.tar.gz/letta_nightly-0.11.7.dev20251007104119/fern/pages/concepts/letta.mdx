## Letta and MemGPT

**[Letta](https://letta.com)** was created by the same team that created **[MemGPT](https://research.memgpt.ai)**.

### MemGPT: The Research Paper

**MemGPT is a research paper** ([arXiv:2310.08560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560)) that introduced foundational concepts for building stateful LLM agents:

- **Self-editing memory** - LLMs using tools to edit their own context window and external storage
- **LLM Operating System** - Infrastructure layer managing agent state, memory, and execution
- **Memory hierarchy** - Distinguishing between in-context memory (core) and out-of-context memory (archival)
- **Context window management** - Intelligent paging and memory consolidation techniques

The paper demonstrated that LLMs could maintain coherent conversations far beyond their context window limits by actively managing their own memory through tool calling.

### MemGPT: The Agent Architecture

MemGPT also refers to a **specific agent architecture** popularized by the research paper. A MemGPT agent has:
- Memory editing tools (`memory_replace`, `memory_insert`, `memory_rethink`)
- Archival memory tools (`archival_memory_insert`, `archival_memory_search`)
- Conversation search tools (`conversation_search`, `conversation_search_date`)
- A structured context window with persona and human memory blocks

This architecture makes MemGPT agents particularly effective for long-range chat applications, document search, and personalized assistants.

### Letta: The Framework

**Letta is a production framework** that allows you to build and deploy agents with MemGPT-style memory systems (and beyond) as **services** behind REST APIs.

While the MemGPT research focused on the agent architecture and memory system, Letta provides:
- **Production infrastructure** - Database backends, persistence, state management
- **Agent runtime** - Tool execution, reasoning loops, multi-agent orchestration
- **Developer tools** - Agent Development Environment (ADE), SDKs, monitoring
- **Deployment options** - Letta Cloud for managed hosting, or self-hosted with Docker
- **Flexibility** - Build MemGPT agents, or design custom agent architectures with different memory systems

**In short:**
- **MemGPT (research)** = Ideas about how agents should manage memory
- **MemGPT (architecture)** = Specific agent design with memory tools
- **Letta (framework)** = Production system for building and deploying stateful agents

## Agents in Context

The concept of "agents" has a long history across multiple fields:

**In reinforcement learning and AI**, agents are entities that:
1. Perceive their environment through sensors
2. Make decisions based on internal state
3. Take actions that affect their environment
4. Learn from outcomes to improve future decisions

**In economics and game theory**, agents are autonomous decision-makers with their own objectives and strategies.

**In LLMs**, agents extend these concepts by using language models for reasoning and tool calling for actions. Letta's approach emphasizes:
- **Statefulness** - Persistent memory and identity across sessions
- **Autonomy** - Self-directed memory management and multi-step reasoning
- **Tool use** - Modifying internal state and accessing external resources

## LLM Operating System

The **LLM OS** is the infrastructure layer that manages agent execution and state. This concept, introduced in the MemGPT paper, draws an analogy to traditional operating systems:

Just as an OS manages memory, processes, and I/O for programs, the LLM OS manages:
- **Memory layer** - Context window management, paging, and persistence
- **Agent runtime** - Tool execution and the reasoning loop
- **Stateful layer** - Coordination across database, cache, and execution

Letta implements this LLM OS architecture, providing the infrastructure for stateful agent services.

## Self-Editing Memory

A key innovation from the MemGPT research is **self-editing memory** - agents that actively manage their own memory using tools.

Traditional RAG systems passively retrieve documents. Letta agents actively:
- **Edit in-context memory** - Update memory blocks based on learned information
- **Manage archival storage** - Decide what facts to persist long-term
- **Search strategically** - Query their memory when relevant context is needed

This active memory management enables agents to learn and evolve through interactions rather than requiring retraining or prompt engineering.
