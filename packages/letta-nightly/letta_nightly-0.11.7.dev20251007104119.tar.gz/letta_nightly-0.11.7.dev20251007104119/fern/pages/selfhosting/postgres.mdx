## Connecting your own Postgres instance
You can set `LETTA_PG_URI` to connect your own Postgres instance to Letta. Your database must have the `pgvector` vector extension installed.

You can enable this extension by running the following SQL command:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```
