title: Connecting with Livekit Agents

<Warning>
Voice agents support is experimental and may be unstable. For more information, visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/letta).
</Warning>

You can build an end-to-end stateful voice agent using Letta and Livekit. You can see a full example in the [letta-voice](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-voice) repository.

For this example, you will need accounts with the following providers:
* [Livekit](https://livekit.io/) for handling the voice connection
* [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) for speech-to-text
* [Cartesia](https://cartesia.io/) for text-to-speech

You will also need to set up the following environment variables (or create a `.env` file):
```sh
LETTA_API_KEY=... # Letta Cloud API key (if using cloud)

LIVEKIT_URL=wss://<YOUR-ROOM>.livekit.cloud # Livekit URL
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=... # Livekit API key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=... # Livekit API secret

DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=... # Deepgram API key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=... # Cartesia API key
```

## Connecting to Letta Cloud
To connect to LiveKit, you can use the Letta connector `openai.LLM.with_letta` and pass in the `agent_id` of your voice agent.

Below is an example defining an entrypoint for a Livekit agent with Letta:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from livekit import agents
from livekit.agents import AgentSession, Agent, AutoSubscribe
from livekit.plugins import (
    openai,
    cartesia,
    deepgram,
)
load_dotenv()

async def entrypoint(ctx: agents.JobContext):
    agent_id = os.environ.get('LETTA_AGENT_ID')
    print(f"Agent id: {agent_id}")
    session = AgentSession(
        llm=openai.LLM.with_letta(
            agent_id=agent_id,
        ),
        stt=deepgram.STT(),
        tts=cartesia.TTS(),
    )

    await session.start(
        room=ctx.room,
        agent=Agent(instructions=""), # instructions should be set in the Letta agent
    )

    session.say("Hi, what's your name?")
    await ctx.connect(auto_subscribe=AutoSubscribe.AUDIO_ONLY)
```
You can see the full script [here](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-voice/blob/main/main.py).

## Connecting to a self-hosted Letta server
You can also connect to a self-hosted server by specifying a `base_url`. To use LiveKit, your Letta sever needs to run with HTTPs. The easiest way to do this is by connecting ngrok to your Letta server.

### Setting up `ngrok`
If you are self-hosting the Letta server locally (at `localhost`), you will need to use `ngrok` to expose your Letta server to the internet:
1. Create an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Create an auth token and add it into your CLI
```
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>
```
3. Point your ngrok server to your Letta server:
```
ngrok http http://localhost:8283
```
Now, you should have a forwarding URL like `https://<YOUR_FORWARDING_URL>.ngrok.app`.

### Connecting LiveKit to a self-hosted Letta server
To connect a LiveKit agent to a self-hosted Letta server, you can use the same code as above, but with the `base_url` parameter set to the forwarding URL you got from ngrok (or whatever HTTPS URL the Letta server is running on).

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from livekit import agents
from livekit.agents import AgentSession, Agent, AutoSubscribe
from livekit.plugins import (
    openai,
    cartesia,
    deepgram,
)
load_dotenv()

async def entrypoint(ctx: agents.JobContext):
    agent_id = os.environ.get('LETTA_AGENT_ID')
    print(f"Agent id: {agent_id}")
    session = AgentSession(
        llm=openai.LLM.with_letta(
            agent_id=agent_id,
            base_url="https://<YOUR_FORWARDING_URL>.ngrok.app", # point to your Letta server
        ),
        stt=deepgram.STT(),
        tts=cartesia.TTS(),
    )

    await session.start(
        room=ctx.room,
        agent=Agent(instructions=""), # instructions should be set in the Letta agent
    )

    session.say("Hi, what's your name?")
    await ctx.connect(auto_subscribe=AutoSubscribe.AUDIO_ONLY)
```
