## New Features

### Google Vertex support

Google Vertex is now a supported endpoint type for Letta agents.

### Option to disable message persistence for a given agent

Letta agents now have an optional `message_buffer_autoclear` flag. If set to True (default False), the message history will not be persisted in-context between requests (though the agent will still have access to core, archival, and recall memory).
