## Added List Run Steps API

We've introduced a new API endpoint that allows you to list all steps associated with a specific run. This feature makes it easier to track and analyze the sequence of steps performed during a run.

```python title="python"
from letta_client import Letta
client = Letta(
    token="YOUR_API_KEY",
)
steps = client.runs.list_run_steps(
    run_id="RUN_ID",
)
for step in steps:
    print(f"Step ID: {step.id}, Tokens: {step.total_tokens}")
```
```typescript title="node.js"
import { LettaClient } from '@letta-ai/letta-client';
const client = new LettaClient({
  token: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
const steps = await client.runs.listRunSteps({
  run_id: "RUN_ID",
});
steps.forEach(step => {
  console.log(`Step ID: ${step.id}, Tokens: ${step.total_tokens}`);
});
```
