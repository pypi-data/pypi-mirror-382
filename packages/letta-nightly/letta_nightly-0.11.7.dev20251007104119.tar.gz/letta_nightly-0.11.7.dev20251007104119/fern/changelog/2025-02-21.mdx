## New Identities Feature

We've added a new Identities feature that helps you manage users in your multi-user Letta application. Each Identity can represent a user or organization in your system and store their metadata.

You can associate an Identity with one or more agents, making it easy to track which agents belong to which users. Agents can also be associated with multiple identities, enabling shared access across different users. This release includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing Identities through our API.

For more information on usage, visit our [Identities documentation](/api-reference/identities) and [usage guide](/guides/agents/multi-user).
