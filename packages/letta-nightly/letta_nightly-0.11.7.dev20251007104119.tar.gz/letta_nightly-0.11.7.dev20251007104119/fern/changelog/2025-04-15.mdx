## New Batch message creation API

A series of new `Batch` endpoints has been introduced to support batch message creation, allowing you to perform multiple LLM requests in a single API call. These APIs leverage provider batch APIs under the hood, which can be more cost-effective than making multiple API calls.

New endpoints can be found here: [Batch Messages](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/messages/batch)
