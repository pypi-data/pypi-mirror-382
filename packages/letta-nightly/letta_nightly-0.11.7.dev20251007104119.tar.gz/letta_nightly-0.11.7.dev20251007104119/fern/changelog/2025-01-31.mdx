### Tool rules improvements

ToolRule objects no longer should specify a `type` at instantiation, as this field is now immutable.

#### Before:
```python
  rule = InitToolRule(
    tool_name="secret_message",
    type="run_first"
)
```

#### After:
```python
  rule = InitToolRule(tool_name="secret_message")
```

Letta also now supports smarter retry behavior for tool rules in the case of unrecoverable failures.

### New API routes to query agent steps

The [`List Steps`](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/steps/list-steps) and [`Retrieve Step`](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/steps/retrieve-step) routes have been added to enable querying for additional metadata around agent execution.
