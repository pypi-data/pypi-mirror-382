## New `reasoning_effort` field added to LLMConfig

The `reasoning_effort` field has been added to the `LLMConfig` object to control the amount of reasoning the model should perform, to support OpenAI's o1 and o3 reasoning models.

## New `sender_id` parameter added to Message model

The `Message` object now includes a `sender_id` field, which is the ID of the sender of the message, which can be either an identity ID or an agent ID. The `sender_id` is expected to be passed in at message creation time.
