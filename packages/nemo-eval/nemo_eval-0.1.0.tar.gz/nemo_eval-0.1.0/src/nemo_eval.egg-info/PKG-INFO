## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment with PyTriton as the Serving Backend

```python
from nemo_eval.api import deploy

# Deploy model
deploy(
    nemo_checkpoint="/path/to/checkpoint",
    serving_backend="pytriton",
    server_port=8080,
    num_gpus=1,
    max_input_len=8192,
    max_batch_size=4
)
```

### Basic Evaluation

```Python
from nvidia_eval_commons.core.evaluate import evaluate
from nvidia_eval_commons.api.api_dataclasses import ApiEndpoint, ConfigParams, EvaluationConfig, EvaluationTarget
# Configure Endpoint
api_endpoint = ApiEndpoint(
    url="http://0.0.0.0:8080/v1/completions/",
    type="completions",
    model_id="megatron_model"
)
# Evaluation target configuration
target = EvaluationTarget(api_endpoint=api_endpoint)
# Configure EvaluationConfig with type, number of samples to evaluate on, etc.
config = EvaluationConfig(type="gsm8k",
            output_dir="results",
            params=ConfigParams(
                    limit_samples=10
                ))

# Run evaluation
results = evaluate(target_cfg=target, eval_cfg=config)
```

### Use Adapters

The example below demonstrates how to configure an Adapter to provide a custom system prompt. Requests and responses are processed through interceptors, which are automatically selected based on the parameters defined in `AdapterConfig`.

```python
from nemo_eval.utils.api import AdapterConfig

# Configure adapter for reasoning
adapter_config = AdapterConfig(
    interceptors=[
        dict(name="reasoning", config={"end_reasoning_token": "</think>"}),
        dict(name="system_message", config={"system_message": "Detailed thinking on"}),
        dict(name="request_logging", config={"max_requests": 5}),
        dict(name="response_logging", config={"max_responses": 5}),
    ]
)

target = EvaluationTarget(
    api_endpoint={
        "url": "http://0.0.0.0:8080/v1/chat/completions/",
        "model_id": "megatron_model",
        "type": "chat",
        "adapter_config": adapter_config
    }
)

# Run evaluation with adapter
results = evaluate(
    target_cfg=target,
    eval_cfg=config,
)
```

### Deploy with Multiple GPUs

```python
# Deploy with tensor parallelism or pipeline parallelism
deploy(
    nemo_checkpoint="/path/to/checkpoint",
    serving_backend="pytriton",
    num_gpus=4,
    tensor_parallelism_size=4,
    pipeline_parallelism_size=1,
    max_input_len=8192,
    max_batch_size=8
)
```
