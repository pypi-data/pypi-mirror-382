# Usage
Pyalab is a way to use Python to generate programs for Vialab---the software that controls the Integra ASSIST Plus automated liquid handling robot.

Documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://pyalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

Don't want to figure out how to install Python on your computer?  No problem! Use this MyBinder link to launch a free online environment (no sign-up required) where you can use `pyalab` to create and then download your Vialab programs.
