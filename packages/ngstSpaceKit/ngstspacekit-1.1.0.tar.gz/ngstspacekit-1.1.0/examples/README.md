# Examples

Here, several examples are provided on how to use the implemented spaces.
You can convert the `.py` files into `.ipynb` jupyter notebooks, by invoking
[jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-cli.html):
```bash
jupytext --to notebook notebook_of_your_choice.py
```

You can also check out the [examples as a jupyter-book](https://johann-cm.codeberg.page/ngstspacekit/examples/index.html).
