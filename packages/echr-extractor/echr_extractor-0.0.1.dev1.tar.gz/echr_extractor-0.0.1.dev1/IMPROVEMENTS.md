# ECHR Extractor Improvements - Technical Documentation

## Overview

Improved error handling, memory management, and processing capabilities. These changes address reliability issues in large-scale data extraction while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Problem Statement

### Issues Addressed

- Large data extractions frequently failed due to API timeouts
- Memory consumption issues when processing large datasets
- Lack of progress visibility during long-running extractions
- Limited error recovery mechanisms for network failures

### Impact

- Failed extractions required manual intervention and restart
- Large datasets could not be processed due to memory constraints
- Users had no visibility into extraction progress
- Network interruptions caused complete extraction failures

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Date Range Batching System

**Implementation:**

- Automatically splits large date ranges into manageable chunks (default: 365 days)
- Prevents API timeouts that previously caused extraction failures
- Processes each chunk independently with proper error handling

**Technical Details:**

- Chunk size is configurable via `days_per_batch` parameter
- Each chunk is processed as a separate API request
- Failed chunks can be retried independently

**Code Example:**

```python
# Automatic batching for large date ranges
df = get_echr(
    start_date='2010-01-01',
    end_date='2020-12-31',
    days_per_batch=365  # Processes in 1-year chunks
)
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Implementation:**

- Implements exponential backoff retry strategy (2^count seconds, max 30s)
- Better error detection with HTTP status code checking
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

**Technical Details:**

- Retry strategy: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Error types handled: timeouts, connection errors, HTTP errors
- Comprehensive logging with error context

### 3. Progress Tracking

**Implementation:**

- Real-time progress bars using tqdm library
- Batch-level progress reporting
- Clear status messages and completion estimates

**Technical Details:**

- Progress bars show current batch and overall progress
- Configurable via `progress_bar` parameter
- Displays processing speed and estimated completion time

**Example Output:**

```
Batch 1/5: 2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31: 100%|██████████| 1500/1500 [05:30<00:00, 4.54it/s]
Batch 2/5: 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31: 100%|██████████| 1200/1200 [04:20<00:00, 4.61it/s]
```

### 4. Memory Management

**Implementation:**

- Chunked processing for large datasets (10,000 records per chunk)
- Automatic garbage collection between chunks
- Configurable memory efficiency settings

**Technical Details:**

- Memory-efficient processing controlled by `memory_efficient` parameter
- Garbage collection forced between chunks to free memory
- Prevents memory accumulation during large extractions

### 5. Configuration Parameters

**New Parameters:**

- `batch_size`: Records per API request (default: 500, max: 500)
- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 60)
- `retry_attempts`: Number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- `max_attempts`: Maximum total attempts (default: 20)
- `days_per_batch`: Days per date batch (default: 365)
- `progress_bar`: Show progress bars (default: True)
- `memory_efficient`: Use chunked processing (default: True)

## Performance Improvements

### Memory Usage

- Memory consumption is now controlled through chunked processing
- Large datasets are processed in 10,000-record chunks
- Garbage collection is forced between chunks to prevent memory accumulation

### Error Recovery

- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Network failures no longer cause complete extraction failures
- Individual chunks can be retried independently

### Progress Visibility

- Real-time progress bars show extraction status
- Users can monitor progress and estimate completion time
- Batch-level reporting provides detailed progress information

## Backward Compatibility

### Compatibility Guarantee

- All existing code continues to work unchanged
- New parameters are optional with sensible defaults
- Original function signatures preserved
- Default behavior identical to previous version

### Migration Path

```python
# Existing code - works exactly as before
df = get_echr(start_id=0, end_id=1000, verbose=True)

# Enhanced code - same result, additional features available
df = get_echr(
    start_id=0,
    end_id=1000,
    verbose=True,
    batch_size=250,        # Optional: smaller batches
    progress_bar=True,     # Optional: show progress
    memory_efficient=True  # Optional: use chunked processing
)
```
