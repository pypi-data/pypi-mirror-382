           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
           the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
           the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
           and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
           or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
           License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
           of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Overview

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/valyu-search-haystack.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/valyu-search-haystack)
[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/valyu-search-haystack.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/valyu-search-haystack)

Haystack components for integrating Valyu's powerful search and content extraction APIs into your Haystack pipelines.

This package provides two main components:

- **`ValyuSearch`** - Search component that queries the Valyu DeepSearch API and returns documents with content already included
- **`ValyuContentFetcher`** - Content extraction component that fetches and cleans content from URLs

**Key Features:**

- Search across web and proprietary sources
- Full content included in search results
- AI-powered content extraction and summarization

---

## Installation

Use `pip` to install Valyu Search for Haystack:

```console
pip install valyu-search-haystack
```

Or install from source:

```console
pip install -e .
```

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.8+
- haystack-ai >= 2.0.0
- valyu >= 2.2.1

## Usage

Set your Valyu API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export VALYU_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### ValyuSearch

The `ValyuSearch` component integrates with the Valyu DeepSearch API. Unlike many search APIs, Valyu returns full content by default, making it ideal for RAG pipelines.

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from valyu_haystack import ValyuSearch
from haystack import Pipeline

# Create a search component (API key from VALYU_API_KEY env var)
search = ValyuSearch(
    top_k=5,
    search_type="all",  # "web", "proprietary", or "all"
    relevance_threshold=0.5
)

# Create and run a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_component("search", search)

result = pipeline.run({"search": {"query": "What is Haystack AI?"}})
documents = result["search"]["documents"]
links = result["search"]["links"]
```

**Component Parameters:**

- `api_key` (Secret): Your Valyu API key. Defaults to `VALYU_API_KEY` environment variable
- `top_k` (int, default=10): Maximum number of results to return
- `api_base_url` (str): Base URL for the Valyu API
- `search_type` (Literal["web", "proprietary", "all"], default="all"): Type of search
- `relevance_threshold` (float, default=0.5): Minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0)
- `max_price` (int, default=100): Maximum price per thousand queries in cents

**Output:**

- `documents` (List[Document]): Documents with content and rich metadata
- `links` (List[str]): List of URLs from search results

**Metadata included:**

- `title`: Page title
- `url`: Source URL
- `description`: Page description
- `source`: Data source identifier
- `relevance_score`: Relevance score (0.0-1.0)
- `price`: Cost of this result
- `length`: Content length in characters
- `data_type`: Type of data ("structured" or "unstructured")
- `image_url`: Associated image URL (if any)

### ValyuContentFetcher

The `ValyuContentFetcher` component extracts clean, readable content from URLs using the Valyu Contents API. It supports batch processing and AI-powered summarization.

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from valyu_haystack import ValyuContentFetcher
from haystack import Pipeline

# Create a content fetcher component
fetcher = ValyuContentFetcher(
    extract_effort="normal",  # "normal", "high", or "auto"
    response_length="short",  # "short", "medium", "large", "max", or int
    summary=True  # Enable AI summarization
)

# Create and run a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_component("fetcher", fetcher)

urls = ["https://example.com/article1", "https://example.com/article2"]
result = pipeline.run({"fetcher": {"urls": urls}})
documents = result["fetcher"]["documents"]
```

**Component Parameters:**

- `api_key` (Secret): Your Valyu API key. Defaults to `VALYU_API_KEY` environment variable
- `api_base_url` (str): Base URL for the Valyu API
- `timeout` (int, default=30): Request timeout in seconds
- `extract_effort` (Literal["normal", "high", "auto"], optional): Extraction thoroughness
- `response_length` (Union[Literal["short", "medium", "large", "max"], int], optional): Content length per URL
- `summary` (Union[bool, str, Dict], optional): AI summary config
  - `False` or `None`: No AI processing (raw content)
  - `True`: Basic automatic summarization
  - `str`: Custom instructions (max 500 chars)
  - `dict`: JSON schema for structured extraction

**Input:**

- `urls` (List[str], optional): List of URLs to fetch
- `documents` (List[Document], optional): Documents with URLs in metadata

**Output:**

- `documents` (List[Document]): Documents with extracted content

**Metadata included:**

- `url`: Source URL
- `title`: Page title
- `length`: Content length in characters
- `source`: Data source identifier
- `data_type`: Type of content

### RAG Pipeline Example

Combine `ValyuSearch` with other Haystack components to build a complete RAG pipeline:

```python
from valyu_haystack import ValyuSearch
from haystack import Pipeline
from haystack.components.generators import OpenAIGenerator
from haystack.components.builders import PromptBuilder
from haystack.utils import Secret

# Create components
search = ValyuSearch(top_k=5)
prompt_builder = PromptBuilder(template="""
Answer the question based on the following context:

Context:
{% for doc in documents %}
{{ doc.content }}
{% endfor %}

Question: {{ query }}
Answer:
""")
generator = OpenAIGenerator(api_key=Secret.from_env_var("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Build pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_component("search", search)
pipeline.add_component("prompt", prompt_builder)
pipeline.add_component("llm", generator)

# Connect components
pipeline.connect("search.documents", "prompt.documents")
pipeline.connect("prompt.prompt", "llm.prompt")

# Run RAG pipeline
result = pipeline.run({
    "search": {"query": "What is Haystack?"},
    "prompt": {"query": "What is Haystack?"}
})

answer = result["llm"]["replies"][0]
```

### Combined Search and Content Fetching

Since `ValyuSearch` already returns content, `ValyuContentFetcher` is typically used for additional URLs or re-fetching with different parameters:

```python
from valyu_haystack import ValyuSearch, ValyuContentFetcher
from haystack import Pipeline

# Create components
search = ValyuSearch(top_k=3)
fetcher = ValyuContentFetcher(
    extract_effort="high",  # More thorough extraction
    summary=True  # Add AI summaries
)

# Create pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_component("search", search)
pipeline.add_component("fetcher", fetcher)

# Connect - fetcher will re-fetch content with enhanced extraction
pipeline.connect("search.documents", "fetcher.documents")

result = pipeline.run({"search": {"query": "machine learning"}})
enhanced_documents = result["fetcher"]["documents"]
```

### Advanced Configuration

**Using explicit API key:**

```python
from haystack.utils import Secret
from valyu_haystack import ValyuSearch

search = ValyuSearch(
    api_key=Secret.from_token("your-api-key"),
    top_k=10,
    search_type="proprietary",  # Search only proprietary sources
    relevance_threshold=0.7  # Higher relevance threshold
)
```

**Structured data extraction with Content Fetcher:**

```python
from valyu_haystack import ValyuContentFetcher

# Define JSON schema for structured extraction
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {"type": "string"},
        "author": {"type": "string"},
        "published_date": {"type": "string"},
        "summary": {"type": "string"}
    }
}

fetcher = ValyuContentFetcher(summary=schema)
result = fetcher.run(urls=["https://example.com/article"])

# Extracted structured data will be in document metadata
```

## Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for more detailed examples:

- `real_content_api_example.py` - Additional content API example

Run examples:

```bash
export VALYU_API_KEY="your-api-key"
python examples/basic_search.py
```

## API Integration Details

### Authentication

Both components use Haystack's `Secret` class for secure API key management:

- Header: `x-api-key: your-api-key`
- Environment variable: `VALYU_API_KEY`

### Endpoints

- **Search:** `https://api.valyu.network/v1/deepsearch`
- **Contents:** `https://api.valyu.network/v1/contents`

### Error Handling

Components raise specific exceptions:

- `ValyuSearchError`: Errors from the search API
- `ValyuContentFetcherError`: Errors from the content API
- `TimeoutError`: Request timeouts
