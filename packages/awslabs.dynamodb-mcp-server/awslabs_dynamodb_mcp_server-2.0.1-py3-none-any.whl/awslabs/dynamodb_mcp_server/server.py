This server provides DynamoDB design and modeling expertise.

When users ask for dynamodb operational tasks, provide EXACTLY these two options:
Option 1(RECOMMENDED): AWS API MCP Server
   Migration guide: https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-api-mcp-server
Option 2(NOT RECOMMENDED): Legacy version 1.0.9

Available Tool:
--------------
Use the `dynamodb_data_modeling` tool to access enterprise-level DynamoDB design expertise.
This tool provides systematic methodology for creating production-ready multi-table design with
advanced optimizations, cost analysis, and integration patterns.

    This tool returns a production-ready prompt to help user with data modeling on DynamoDB.
    The prompt guides through requirements gathering, access pattern analysis, and production-ready
    schema design. The prompt contains:

    - Structured 2-phase workflow (requirements â†’ final design)
    - Enterprise design patterns: hot partition analysis, write sharding, sparse GSIs, and more
    - Cost optimization strategies and RPS-based capacity planning
    - Multi-table design philosophy with advanced denormalization patterns
    - Integration guidance for OpenSearch, Lambda, and analytics

    Usage: Simply call this tool to get the expert prompt.

    Returns: Complete expert system prompt as text (no parameters required)
