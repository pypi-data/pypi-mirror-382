v11.6.0 (2025-09-26)
====================

Misc
----

- Integrate dkist-processing-core 6.0.0 which brings a swap of Elastic APM to OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing. (`#268 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/268>`__)
- Added common meters to instrument reads/writes and a framework for observing task progress. (`#268 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/268>`__)


v11.5.1 (2025-09-17)
====================

Misc
----

- Update the redis SDK to the latest version to deploy concurrently with an updated redis server. (`#269 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/269>`__)


v11.5.0 (2025-09-08)
====================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-core to 5.2.0 which includes upgrades to airflow 2.11.0 and requires Python 3.12+. (`#266 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/266>`__)


v11.4.0 (2025-09-04)
====================

Features
--------

- Create new MetadataKey string enum class.  Replace usages like `metadata_key="keyword_name"`
  with `metadata_key=MetadataKey.keyword_name`.  Note that unlike other enum classes, we are using
  the name, not the value. Stem bases now check if they are passed a MetadataKey, and take
  the name as the required string. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/265>`__)
- Add `_set_metadata_key_value` method to FitsAccessBase that takes a StrEnum and sets
  a class attribute.  The attribute name is the StrEnum name and the attribute value
  gets the header value with the StrEnum value as key. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/265>`__)


Misc
----

- Change classes that inherit from `str` and `Enum` to inherit `StrEnum` instead: BudName, StemName, TaskName.  Convert
  strings to class members where relevant. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/265>`__)


v11.3.0 (2025-08-30)
====================

Misc
----

- Split out writing L1 frame timing headers so that their calculation can be separately defined by instruments, as required. (`#263 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/263>`__)
- Update pre-commit hook versions and replace python-reorder-imports with isort. (`#264 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/264>`__)


v11.2.1 (2025-08-12)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Add `multi_plot_data` to quality creation mutation when submitting quality report data. (`#262 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/262>`__)


Misc
----

- Explicitly set color and ordering of lines in wavecal metric plots.
  This gets around issues with order not being preserved in the quality database. (`#262 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/262>`__)
- Update database name for vertical multi-pane plot metric data. It's now called "multi_plot_data". (`#262 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/262>`__)


v11.2.0 (2025-07-18)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Move the writing of spectral line keys in L1 data to later in the process, after the instruments have had a chance to rewrite the WCS info. (`#252 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/252>`__)


v11.1.0 (2025-07-15)
====================

Misc
----

- The graphql and input dataset models are now set to validate whenever attributes are assigned, including after instantiation. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/255>`__)
- Create a factory for custom `FakeGQLClient` used in tests.  The factory and associated default returns live in a
  new `mock_metadata_store.py` module in the tests directory.  `FakeGQLClient` is now a test fixture and does not need to
  be imported in tests. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/255>`__)
- Fix a Pydantic warning in the graphql model.  Because we validate the `RecipeRunConfiguration` as a JSON dictionary and
  convert it to a model after validation, we need a serializer so Pydantic knows what to expect back out. (`#258 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/258>`__)


v11.0.1 (2025-07-10)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Ignore NaN and Inf values when storing the quality results of a wavelength calibration fit. (`#260 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/260>`__)


Misc
----

- Removing usages of `pkg_resources`, which is on track to be deprecated. (`#254 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/254>`__)


v11.0.0 (2025-07-02)
====================

Features
--------

- Move `location_of_dkist` from the `WriteL1` task to its own module (`~dkist_processing_common.models.dkist_location`).
  Also make it a constant variable instead of a function. (`#256 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/256>`__)
- `Stems` that only match a specific task types can now check against a list of task types.
  This replaces the `ip_task_type` kwarg with `ip_task_types` (which can still be a single string, if desired.) (`#257 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/257>`__)
- Add ability to store and build a quality metric showing the results of wavelength calibration. (`#259 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/259>`__)


v10.9.0 (2025-06-02)
====================

Features
--------

- Add two new codecs:  Basemodel codecs are used for encoding and decoding Pydantic BaseModel objects.  For decoding, the intended model
  is passed to the decoder through a keyword argument in the task read method.  Array codecs are used for encoding and decoding numpy
  arrays similar to the standard np.load() and np.save(), but with the task tag-based write method. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)


Misc
----

- Remove the input_dataset mixin and replace it with input_dataset Pydantic BaseModel models. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)
- Change the behavior of ParameterBase such that it takes the task scratch as an argument to provide access to the
  parameter document and parameters that are files.  This behavior replaces the input dataset mixin parameter read method. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)


v10.8.3 (2025-05-28)
====================

Features
--------

- Further constrain when the ATMOS_R0 header key is written in L1 data based on the following metrics:

  * the ATMOS_R0 value in the L0 data must be less than or equal to 30cm
  * the AO_LOCK value in the L0 data must be True
  * the OOBSHIFT value in the L0 data must be less than 100

  The wavefront sensor has about 1500 subapertures from which x and y shifts are measured. When the adaptive optics loop is locked, we count how many of these shifts exceed a threshold considered to be out of bounds. The r0 measurement gets less accurate as more of these shifts are out of bounds and so this is another way to detect outliers in the r0 value. (`#250 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/250>`__)


v10.8.2 (2025-05-27)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Prevent the `WAVEBAND` key from being populated with a spectral line that falls outside the wavelength bounds of the data. (`#251 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/251>`__)


v10.8.1 (2025-05-22)
====================

Misc
----

- Update `dkist-processing-core` to v5.1.1. (`#253 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/253>`__)


v10.8.0 (2025-05-15)
====================

Features
--------

- Add checksum verification to the hdu decoder. (`#222 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/222>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Modify usage of CompImageHeader to support astropy 7. (`#222 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/222>`__)


v10.7.2 (2025-04-21)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug in which the AO_LOCK header key is assumed to exist.  The AO_LOCK header key is optional. (`#249 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/249>`__)


v10.7.1 (2025-04-17)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug exposed by updates in the `dkist-inventory` package that did not manage HISTORY or COMMENT cards correctly. (`#248 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/248>`__)


v10.7.0 (2025-04-14)
====================

Features
--------

- New data percentiles are added to the headers to make the range symmetric. (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/242>`__)
- L1 headers are now created by removing only the keys listed in SPEC-122 as opposed to removing all keys not present in SPEC-214. In addition, any SPEC-214 keys marked as `level0_only` are removed. This will allow spurious header keys to be discovered more easily. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/246>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Header keys that write the percentiles of the data are now correctly named (from DATA<pp> to DATAP<pp>). (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/242>`__)


Misc
----

- Prevent header keys from being included if they are not a part of the Level 1 SPEC-0214 specification. (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/242>`__)
- Add missing build dependency specifications. (`#247 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/247>`__)


v10.6.4 (2025-03-31)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Allow input dataset IDs to be conditionally written into the L1 data headers. (`#243 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/243>`__)


v10.6.3 (2025-03-27)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug where transfer input dataset fails if any of the input dataset part documents are missing. (`#241 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/241>`__)
- Pydantic model validator now returns the validated instance. (`#240 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/240>`__)

v10.6.2 (2025-03-19)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug in manual processing where a metadata store dataclass has been previously converted to
  a Pydantic BaseModel.  Add a test that will catch future similar bugs. (`#239 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/239>`__)


Misc
----

- Add coverage badge to README.rst. (`#238 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/238>`__)


v10.6.1 (2025-03-14)
====================

Misc
----

- Convert dataclasses in the graphql model to Pydantic BaseModels for additional validation. In the
  RecipeRunResponse class, configuration is converted from a JSON dictionary to its own Pydantic BaseModel.
  In the InputDatasetPartResponse class, the inputDatasetPartDocument is now returned as a list of dictionaries. (`#236 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/236>`__)
- Change returns from the metadata store queries into Pydantic BaseModel instances.  Remove unnecessary parsing
  and error checking in the metadata store mixin. (`#236 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/236>`__)


v10.6.0 (2025-03-03)
====================

Features
--------

- Add the `RetarderNameBud` that can parse the name of the GOS retarder and ensure that only a single retarder was used
  for the given set of POLCAL input data. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)


v10.5.15 (2025-02-24)
=====================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-core to 5.1.0 to use apache-airflow 2.10.5. (`#234 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/234>`__)


v10.5.14 (2025-02-19)
=====================

Features
--------

- Compute PRODUCT L1 header key from IDSOBSID and PROCTYPE.  The minimum productId length is 8 characters. (`#232 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/232>`__)


v10.5.13 (2025-02-14)
=====================

Misc
----

- Bump version of `dkist-processing-core` to 5.0.0; automated processing workers will now use the "frozen" pip extra of
  instrument pipelines to ensure a constant environment for a given version of that pipeline. (`#233 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/233>`__)


v10.5.12 (2025-02-12)
=====================

Features
--------

- Compute datasetId using sqids rather than hashids.  The minimum datasetId length is now 6 characters. (`#231 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/231>`__)


v10.5.11 (2025-02-06)
=====================

Misc
----

- Use the new `dkist_inventory.asdf_generator.make_asdf_file_object` helper function and add a history entry to the trial framework ASDF. (`#230 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/230>`__)


v10.5.10 (2025-02-04)
=====================

Features
--------

- Convert the parse_tag method in scratch from private to public. (`#225 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/225>`__)
- Add list flattening before building a generic filename based on tags to allow for nested lists of tags. (`#225 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/225>`__)


Misc
----

- Fix typo in tags, ``task_geometric_sepectral_shifts`` -> ``task_geometric_spectral_shifts``.  Add type hinting to tags. (`#225 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/225>`__)
- Update Bitbucket pipelines to use execute script for standard steps. (`#229 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/229>`__)


v10.5.9 (2025-01-29)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Update to dkist-processing-common which handles a bug in dacite==1.9.0


v10.5.8 (2025-01-27)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Add more splitting characters to improve the accuracy of getting base package names.


v10.5.7 (2025-01-27)
====================

Features
--------

- Prevent colons from being written as part of tag-created filenames due to being an illegal character under some operating systems. (`#227 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/227>`__)

Documentation
-------------

- Change the documentation landing page to focus more on users and less on developers. (`#223 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/223>`__)


v10.5.4 (2024-12-18)
====================

Features
--------

- Change the quality report to plot and calculate the average of the Fried parameter only where the AO lock status is True. (`#221 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/221>`__)
- Remove the Fried parameter header keyword from final FITS files where the AO system was unlocked. (`#221 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/221>`__)


v10.5.3 (2024-11-25)
====================

Misc
----

- Pinning astropy upperbound to < 7.0.0 (`#220 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/220>`__)


v10.5.2 (2024-11-21)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade to dkist-inventory 1.4.3 which patches a bug in creating dataset inventory from SPECLN* keys.


v10.5.1 (2024-11-20)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Constrain asdf < 4.0.0


v10.5.0 (2024-11-20)
====================

Features
--------

- Modify movie assembly to manage a breaking change in the moviepy API. (`#219 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/219>`__)
- Modify the asdf decoder to manage a breaking change in the asdf API. (`#219 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/219>`__)


v10.4.0 (2024-11-14)
====================

Misc
----

- Functions that build the list of items to transfer for a trial outflow are now based on lists of tags
  instead of configuration switches. (`#218 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/218>`__)
- Refactor `TranferTrialDataBase` from an inherited base class to a standalone class
  and rename it `TransferTrialData`. (`#218 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/218>`__)


v10.3.0 (2024-10-15)
====================

Features
--------

- Update the machinery in `quality_store_polcal_results` to handle NaN values.
  This is required for the new error-handling paradigm in `dkist-processing-pac` v3.1.0. (`#214 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/214>`__)
- Add new argument, `num_points_to_sample`, to `quality_store_polcal_results`, which allows a user to reduce the number of points saved for inclusion in the quality report.
  This allows us to mitigate large quality metrics. (`#215 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/215>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Correctly clean up tags used for file name uniqueness. (`#217 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/217>`__)


v10.2.2 (2024-10-14)
====================

Misc
----

- Switch from setup.cfg to pyproject.toml for build configuration (`#214 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/214>`__)
- Make and publish wheels at code push in build pipeline (`#214 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/214>`__)


v10.2.1 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade to dkist-processing-core 4.2.1 which patches a bug causing the doc builds to fail. (`#213 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/213>`__)


v10.2.0 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade dkist-processing-core to 4.2.0 which includes the upgrade of airflow to 2.10.2. (`#212 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/212>`__)


v10.1.0 (2024-09-26)
====================

Features
--------

- Adding the `NearFloatBud` and `TaskNearFloatBud` for use in parsing, for when numeric values in a given header should be within a given range. (`#207 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/207>`__)


v10.0.1 (2024-09-24)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- "FRAMEVOL" key in L1 headers now correctly reports the on-disk size (in MB) of each file. (`#211 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/211>`__)


Misc
----

- Add test coverage for the interservice bus mixin (`#209 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/209>`__)


v10.0.0 (2024-09-23)
====================

Features
--------

- Remove usage of `self.tags` from `WriteL1` task. This greatly improves database usage. It is a breaking change because
  OUTPUT files will no longer share extra tags with their corresponding CALIBRATED files and as a result any downstream
  tasks that depend on richer tags on OUTPUT files will need to swap to using CALIBRATED files instead. (`#210 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/210>`__)


v9.1.0 (2024-09-10)
===================

Misc
----

- Accommodate changes to the GraphQL API associated with refactoring the quality database (`#208 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/208>`__)


v9.0.0 (2024-08-20)
===================

Features
--------

- Greatly improve performance of `QualityL0Metrics` task by eliminating calls to tag database to determine the TASK type
  of *every* file. Instead we now explicitly loop over the TASKs we want and read only those files. (`#205 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/205>`__)
- Allow language in polcal metrics to support binning schemes that aren't 2 dimensional.
  For example, we can now have "...spanning 4 spatial bins." or "...spanning 2 spectral, 4 spatial, and 5 mosaic bins.".
  Any dimensionality is supported (except zero). (`#206 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/206>`__)


v8.2.2 (2024-07-25)
===================

Misc
----

- Rewrite to eliminate warnings in unit tests. (`#203 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/203>`__)


v8.2.1 (2024-07-12)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix bug that accumulated workflow task tags on files written to scratch if the tags passed in were a list and were reused for multiple writes. (`#202 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/202>`__)


v8.2.0 (2024-07-10)
===================

Misc
----

- Make private methods public when we want them to show up in the ReadTheDocs documentation. (`#201 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/201>`__)


v8.1.0 (2024-07-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-core to 4.1.0 which includes an upgrade to airflow 2.9.2. (`#200 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/200>`__)
- Update the instructions for development to include the dependency on redis. (`#200 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/200>`__)


v8.0.0 (2024-06-20)
===================

Features
--------

- Default behavior of `ParameterBase._find_most_recent_past_value` is to use `obs_ip_start_time` as the date. Previously
  the default had been `datetime.now()`. An implication of this is that *all* users of `ParameterBase` should instantiate
  their parameters object with `obs_ip_start_time`. The one exception is parameters needed for parsing, which should
  explicitly pass `datetime.now()` to the `start_date` kwarg of `_find_most_recent_past_value`. (`#198 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/198>`__)
- Add the `ParameterArmIdMixin` for defining parameters that depend on the value of an arm ID constant. (`#199 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/199>`__)
- A method to `ParameterBase` (`_load_param_value_from_fits`) for loading file parameters saved as FITS files. (`#199 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/199>`__)
- Add method to `ParameterBase` (`_load_param_value_from_numpy_save`) for loading file parameters saved as numpy save files. (`#199 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/199>`__)


v7.0.0 (2024-06-03)
===================

Misc
----

- Update `sphinx-auotapi` pin to only exclude the breaking version. The bug was fixed in subsequent versions. (`#195 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/195>`__)
- Resolve matplotlib version conflict (`#196 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/196>`__)
- Upgrade dkist-processing-core to support airflow to 2.9.1 which includes the dependency on pydantic 2 and consequently a few other libraries that needed upgrading for the same pydantic 2 dependency. (`#197 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/197>`__)


v6.2.4 (2024-05-20)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- No longer crash when building polcal metrics where some CS steps had `I_sys` fixed during the polcal fit. (`#193 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/193>`__)
