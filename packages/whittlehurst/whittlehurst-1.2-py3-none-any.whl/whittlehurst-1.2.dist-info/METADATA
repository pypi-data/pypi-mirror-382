## Overview
This module implements Whittle's likelihood estimation method for determining the Hurst exponent of a time series.
The method fits the theoretical spectral density to the periodogram computed from the time series realization.
This implementation includes spectral density approximations for fractional Gaussian noise (increments of fractional Brownian motion) and ARFIMA processes.

The Hurst exponent ($H$) controls the roughness, self-similarity, and long-range dependence of fBm paths:

* $H\in(0,0.5):~$ anti-persistent (mean-reverting) behavior. 
* $H=0.5:~ \mathrm{fBm}(H)$ is the Brownian motion.
* $H\in(0.5,1):~$ persistent behavior.


## Features
* Spectral density options:
  - **`fGn`** *(This is the current default option, corresponding to fGn_Paxson, with K=10)*
  - **`arfima`**
  - `fGn_Paxson`
  - `fGn_Hurwitz`
  - `fGn_truncation`
  - `fGn_Taylor`
* A flexible interface that supports custom spectral density callback functions.
* Good performance both in terms of speed and accuracy.
* Included generators for fBm and ARFIMA.

## Installation
```
pip install whittlehurst
```

## Usage
### Whittle for fBm and fGn
```python
import numpy as np
from whittlehurst import whittle, fbm

# Original Hurst value to test with
H=0.42

# Generate an fBm realization
fBm_seq = fbm(H=H, n=10000)

# Calculate the increments (the estimator works with the fGn spectrum)
fGn_seq = np.diff(fBm_seq)

# Estimate the Hurst exponent
H_est = whittle(fGn_seq)

print(f"Original H: {H:0.04f}, estimated H: {H_est:0.04f}")
```

### TDML for fGn

The Time-Domain Maximum Likelihood (TDML) method estimates $H$ from fGn observations by fitting the likelihood function directly in the time domain.
TDML performs a similar root finding as Whittle's method, but Whittle operates in the frequency domain.
Despite significant optimizations TDML remains much slower than Whittle. 
TDML offers marginally improved accuracy, especially at the edges of the Hurst parameter range.

Usage:
```python
import numpy as np
from whittlehurst import tdml, fbm

# Original Hurst value to test with
H=0.42

# Generate an fBm realization
fBm_seq = fbm(H=H, n=10000)

# Calculate the increments
fGn_seq = np.diff(fBm_seq)

# Estimate the Hurst exponent
H_est = tdml(fGn_seq)

print(f"Original H: {H:0.04f}, estimated H: {H_est:0.04f}")
```

### ARFIMA
```python
import numpy as np
from whittlehurst import whittle, arfima

# Original Hurst value to test with
H=0.42

# Generate a realization of an ARFIMA(0, H - 0.5, 0) process.
arfima_seq = arfima(H=H, n=10000)

# No need to take the increments here
# Estimate the "Hurst exponent" using the ARFIMA spectrum
H_est = whittle(arfima_seq, spectrum="arfima")

print(f"Original H: {H:0.04f}, estimated H: {H_est:0.04f}")
```

## Performance
### Compared to other methods
Our Whittle-based estimator offers a compelling alternative to traditional approaches for estimating the Hurst exponent. In particular, we compare it with:

- **R/S Method:** Implemented in the [hurst](https://github.com/Mottl/hurst) package, this method has been widely used for estimating $H$.

- **Higuchi's Method:** Available through the [antropy](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/antropy) package, it performs quite well especially for smaller $H$ values, but its performance drops when $H\rightarrow 1$.

- **DFA:** Detrended Fluctuation Analysis is a popular Hurst estimator robust for non-stationary processes (this robustness is not required in the below tests). Available through the [nolds](https://pypi.org/project/nolds/) package.

- **Variogram:** Our variogram implementation of order $p = 1$ (madogram) accessible as `from whittlehurst import variogram`.

- **TDML:** Our TDML implementation.

Inference times represent the computation time per input sequence, and were calculated as: $t = w\cdot T/k$, where $k=100000$ is the number of sequences, $w=32$ is the number of workers (processing threads), and $T$ is the total elapsed time. Single-thread performance is likely superior, the results are mainly comparative.

The following results were calculated on $100000$ fBm realizations of length $n=2048$.

### fGn spectral density approximations
The fGn spectral density calculations recommended by Shi et al. are accessible within our package:

- **` fGn`** or ` fGn_Paxson `: The default recommended spectral model. Uses Paxson's approximation with a configurable parameter `K=10`.
- ` fGn_Hurwitz `: Relies on the gamma function and the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,q)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}(j+q)^{-s}$ from [scipy](https://scipy.org/).
- ` fGn_truncation `: Approximates the infinite series by a configurable truncation `K=200`.
- ` fGn_Taylor `: Uses a Taylor series expansion to approximate the spectral density at near-zero frequency.

### ARFIMA
For the $\text{ARFIMA}(0, H - 0.5, 0)$ process, the spectral density calculation is simpler. With terms independent from $H$ or $\lambda$ omitted, we use:

$g(\lambda,H) = (2\cdot\sin(\lambda/2))^{1 - 2H}$
