"""The module for the edge-coloring of the graph.

This file contains code to find the edge coloring of an arbitrary simple graph according to the program defined in
:cite:`Misra_1992`. Almost all functions in this file are helper functions. Only :func:`find_edge_coloring` is intended
for external use. The function :func:`plot_edge_coloring` may be used for debugging purposes.
