Bug fixes
---------

===========================

Bugfix

===========================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix `qubo_graph` and `qubo_matrix` methods of `ConstrainedQuadraticInstance` so that they re-compute the internal attribute `_bqm` everytime they're called and therefore they're up to date with the problem instance.
- Add a small test that checks if all the QUBO representations of `ConstrainedQuadraticInstance` agree, i.e., `qubo_graph`, `qubo_matrix` and `bqm`.

Version 1.13.0 (2025-07-28)
===========================

Bug fixes
---------

===========================

Version 1.10.0 (2025-07-21)
===========================

Bug fixes
---------

- Add a fallback routine to `_get_embedding` which allows it to embed larger problems on QPUs on which it would previously fail, by using a greedy algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph.
- Add a small test to check that it works.
