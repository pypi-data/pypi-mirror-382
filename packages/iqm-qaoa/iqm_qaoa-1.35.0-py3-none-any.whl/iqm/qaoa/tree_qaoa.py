        The tree schedule is designed for problems with uniform 1-body local field, unit 2-body interactions and
        uniform node degree. Therefore, when given a generic problem, the algorithm first calculates the average
        degree ``d_av``, the average local field ``h_av`` and the average interaction strength ``j_av`` (which is used
        to renormalize the local field). The angles are then looked up in the saved files for the nearest implemented
        degree and local field. For :math:`p > 6` QAOA, the angles are interpolated from the calculated angles for
        :math:`p = 6`. The method doesn't output anything, but it modifies :attr:`iqm.qaoa.generic_qaoa.QAOA.angles`
