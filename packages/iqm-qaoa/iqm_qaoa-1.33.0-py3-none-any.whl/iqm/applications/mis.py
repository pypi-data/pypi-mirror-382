"""Module containing the MIS problem instance class.

Two solvers for MIS problems are also provided:

- A simple and fast greedy solver.
- Exact solver based on *Bron-Kerbosch* algorithm to find a graph's cliques.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from iqm.applications.mis import MISInstance
        from iqm.applications.mis import greedy_mis
        from iqm.applications.mis import bron_kerbosch

        my_mis_instance.constraints_checker("101011000")  # Check if this corresponds to an independent set.

        greedy_solution = greedy_mis(my_instance)  # Solution bitstring obtained from greedy.
        bk_solution = bron_kerbosch(my_instance)  # Solution bitstring obtained from BK.
