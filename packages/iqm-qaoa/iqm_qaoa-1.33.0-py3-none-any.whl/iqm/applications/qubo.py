"""Contains problem instance classes for a generic QUBO problem and a genetic constrained QUBO problem.

While objects of these classes can be instantiated, it's generally not recommended. For problems with any added
structure, it is recommended to use sub-classes (children) of these classes, e.g.,
:class:`~iqm.applications.maxcut.MaxCutInstance`, :class:`~iqm.applications.mis.MISInstance` or
:class:`~iqm.applications.sk.SherringtonKirkpatrick`.

        from iqm.applications.qubo import ConstrainedQuadraticInstance

        # Defining a QUBO instance from a ``numpy`` array of interactions.
        my_qubo_instance = QUBOInstance(my_square_np_array)
        my_qubo_instance.fix_variables([0, 2, 4])  # Fixes the variables labelled by 0, 2 and 4 to the value '1'.
