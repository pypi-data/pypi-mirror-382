    a :class:`~iqm.qaoa.transpiler.routing.Routing` is created, a ``problem_graph`` (with edge weights corresponding to
    distances on the HW graph). Then the first two interaction layers are executed. Lastly, the initial version of
    ``buffer_interactions`` is built (and from it, the initial ``buffer_involved_qubits``).
