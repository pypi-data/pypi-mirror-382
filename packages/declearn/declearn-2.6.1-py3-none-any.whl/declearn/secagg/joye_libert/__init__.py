"""Secure Aggregation tools based on Joye-Libert homomorphic summation.

This module implements primitives and controllers to conduct secure
aggregation of values using a homomorphic summation algorithm from
Marc Joye & Beno√Æt Libert published in 2013 [1].

Note that Joye-Libert encryption requires operating over large integer
fields, resulting in a relatively-costly SecAgg scheme, both in terms
of computations and communications, as usual 32-64 bit values end up
converted to (possibly very) large integers.


Controllers
-----------

* [JoyeLibertDecrypter][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.JoyeLibertDecrypter]:
    Controller for the decryption of (homomorphic) sums of encrypted values.
* [JoyeLibertEncrypter][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.JoyeLibertEncrypter]:
    Controller for the encryption of values that need homomorphic summation.

Setup & config
--------------

* [JoyeLibertSecaggConfigClient]\
[declearn.secagg.joye_libert.JoyeLibertSecaggConfigClient]:
    Client-side config and setup controller for Joye-Libert SecAgg.
* [JoyeLibertSecaggConfigServer]\
[declearn.secagg.joye_libert.JoyeLibertSecaggConfigServer]:
    Server-side config and setup controller for Joye-Libert SecAgg.
* [messages][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.messages]:
    Submodule providing with messages for Joye-Libert SecAgg setup routines.

Primitives
----------

* [DEFAULT_BIPRIME][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.DEFAULT_BIPRIME]:
    Default Biprime value used as modulus in Joye-Libert functions.
* [decrypt_sum][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.decrypt_sum]:
    Apply Joye-Libert decryption to an encrypted sum of private values.
* [encrypt][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.encrypt]:
    Apply Joye-Libert encryption to an integer value.
 * [sum_encrypted][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.sum_encrypted]:
    Apply homomorphic summation to some Joye-Libert encrypted values.

Aggregate
---------

* [JLSAggregate][declearn.secagg.joye_libert.JLSAggregate]:
    'Aggregate'-like container for Joye-Libert encrypted values.
