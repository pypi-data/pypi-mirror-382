## 💡 Example Workflows

### Multi-Agent Investment Analysis

**Command**: `/analyze <SYMBOL>`

**What Happens**:

1. **Quill** performs bottom-up fundamental analysis
2. **Macro Lens** validates with top-down economic context
3. **Synthesis** combines both perspectives into final recommendation

<details>
<summary><b>Example: /analyze MSFT (click to expand)</b></summary>

```
You: /analyze MSFT

Investment Analysis Workflow: Starting multi-agent analysis...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS (Quill)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Quill (Equity Research):
  → Calling get_quote(symbol=MSFT)
  ✓ MSFT: $420.45, +0.8%, P/E 31x, Market Cap $3.1T

  → Calling get_earnings_history(symbol=MSFT)
  ✓ 4 consecutive earnings beats, avg +4.2% surprise

  → Calling get_analyst_recommendations(symbol=MSFT)
  ✓ 89% buy ratings, mean target $475 (+13% upside)

  → Calling get_financials(symbol=MSFT)
  ✓ Revenue +15% YoY, 42% gross margin, $87B FCF

**Fundamental Assessment**: STRONG
- Exceptional profitability (42% ROE)
- Consistent earnings outperformance
- Strong analyst conviction
- Reasonable valuation (31x P/E vs 15% growth)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 2: MACRO VALIDATION (Macro Lens)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Macro Lens (Market Strategist):
  → Calling get_key_macro_indicators()
  ✓ GDP +2.4%, CPI +3.1%, Unemployment 3.7%

  → Calling get_treasury_yield_curve()
  ✓ 10Y-2Y inverted -0.54% (recession warning)

  → Calling get_market_indices()
  ✓ S&P 500 +12% YTD, Nasdaq -8% from highs, VIX 14.2

**Macro Context**: LATE EXPANSION with CAUTION
- Inverted yield curve signals recession risk (12-18 month window)
- Tech sector vulnerability (Nasdaq off highs)
- But Microsoft has defensive characteristics

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 3: FINAL SYNTHESIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: BUY (Dollar-Cost Average)
📊 Confidence Level: MEDIUM

**Key Reasoning**:

Microsoft shows exceptional fundamental quality:
- 42% ROE, $87B annual FCF (best-in-class capital efficiency)
- Strong competitive moats (Azure cloud, enterprise software lock-in)
- Consistent earnings beats (+4.2% avg surprise, 4 quarters)
- 89% analyst buy ratings, $475 mean target (+13% upside)

However, macro timing suggests staged entry:
- Late expansion phase (GDP slowing from 2.8% to 2.4%)
- Inverted yield curve (-0.54%) signals 70% recession probability
- Tech sector vulnerable (Nasdaq -8% from highs)

**Suggested Action**:

Instead of full position immediately, dollar-cost average over 3-6 months:
- Tranche 1: 40% now (defensive exposure to quality)
- Tranche 2: 30% if MSFT dips below $390 (-7% from current)
- Tranche 3: 30% if macro deteriorates (recession confirmed)

Microsoft's defensive characteristics (enterprise subscriptions,
recurring revenue) position it to outperform cyclical tech peers
in downturn.

**Risk Warnings**:

1. **Fundamental**: Azure growth deceleration below 25% YoY would
   weaken investment thesis
2. **Valuation**: Recession could compress P/E to 24-26x (historical
   trough), implying 15-20% downside
3. **Macro**: If yield curve steepens rapidly, indicates imminent
   recession—pause accumulation

**Key Insights**:
- NVDA shows exceptional momentum (18.4% avg beat, accelerating)
- Mega-cap tech dominates (7 of top 10)
- Payment processors (V, MA) show consistent quality

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Deep-dive analysis: `/quill` then "Analyze GOOGL"
2. Earnings timing: `/earnings` then "Check NVDA post-earnings drift"
3. Macro validation: `/macro` then "Tech sector positioning"
