# Package obsolete
The implementation of this package is obsolete and will not be 
maintained any longer. Please use its successor `dsslab-wdc-client` 
available at https://pypi.org/project/dsslab-wdc-client/ 

# Description
This project includes a *very* small client to access data form 
the WebDataCollector-API. It is meant to provide a simple means 
of accessing the data in Json or as Panda-DataFrames.

# Usage

```
from dss_wdc_client.client import WDCClient

# Somehow initialize environment variables for 
# "WDC_HOST" and "WDC_TOKEN". 
load_dotenv()

client = WDCClient.fromEnv()
df = client.loadAsDataFrame(
	'api/endpoint...', {'param1', 'value will be encoded'})
```

For more information about the client and usable endpoints, 
see the project homepage of WDC or directly consult the Documentation.
