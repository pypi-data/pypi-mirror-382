## Why docsumm-ai?

Summarizing long documents shouldn’t mean losing meaning.  
Most tools today **truncate context** just to fit into token limits — resulting in shallow, inaccurate summaries.

`docsumm-ai` was built to fix that.

We designed it for **researchers, analysts, and AI developers** who care about both **fidelity and efficiency**.  
It automatically adapts to document structure, ensuring retention of key insights from text, Word, or PDFs — in a single line.

## What Makes It Different

✅ **One-line summarize()** — clean summaries with context retention  
✅ **Handles PDFs, DOCX, TXT** — no format left behind  
✅ **Context-aware chunking** — semantic segmentation, not blind splitting  
✅ **Adaptive compression** — keeps the right level of detail per section  
✅ **CLI + Python API** — works both in scripts and terminal  
✅ **Transparent JSON + Markdown output** — reproducible and human-readable
