## Installation

Install KubeWhisper via pip:

```bash
pip install kubewhisper
```

This will make the `kubewhisper` command available globally.

## Setup

To use KubeWhisper, youâ€™ll need an API token for authentication. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Register**: Start by registering with your email and password.
   ```bash
   kubewhisper --register <email> <password>
   ```
   Check your email for a verification code.

2. **Verify**: Use the verification code sent to your email to complete the registration.
   ```bash
   kubewhisper --verify <email> <code>
   ```

3. **Authenticate**: After verification, authenticate with your credentials.
   ```bash
   kubewhisper --login <email> <password>
   ```

Once authenticated, your credentials will be securely stored for future use.

## Usage

### Query Commands
To generate a `kubectl` command, simply provide your query as an argument:

```bash
kubewhisper "create a pod called my-pod"
```

This will return the suggested `kubectl` command based on your query.

### Auto-complete Execution
To directly execute the generated `kubectl` command, use the `-a` or `--auto-complete` flag:

```bash
kubewhisper "list all pods in dev namespace" --auto-complete
```

If the query is valid, the command will be automatically executed.

### History
Retrieve a history of past queries and responses:

```bash
kubewhisper --history
```

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Generate Kubernetes commands using everyday language.
- **Authentication**: Register and authenticate with the KubeWhisper API for secure access.
- **Auto-complete**: Option to auto-complete and execute suggested commands.
- **Query History**: View past queries and responses.
