class Info:
    """
    A class to manage package operations on a remote system using `apk` (Alpine Linux package manager).

    Attributes:
        package (str): A package name to be queried.
        sudo (bool): If `True`, the commands will be executed with `sudo` privileges.
        su (bool): If `True`, the commands will be executed with `su` privileges.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        yield Info(package='vim')

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used in a generator-based workflow where commands are yielded for execution.

    Notes:
        - Commands are constructed based on the `present`, `sudo`, and `su` flags.
