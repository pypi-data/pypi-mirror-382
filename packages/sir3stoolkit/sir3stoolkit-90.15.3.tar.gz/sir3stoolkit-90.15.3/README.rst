SIR 3S Toolkit
==============

**SIR 3S Toolkit** is a Python package developed by 3S Consult that provides a programming interface for SIR 3S - 
a software for the simulation, analysis and optimization of flow processes in gas/water/heat supply networks, 
plants, pipelines and caverns. 

At its core, the package wraps basic functionality of SIR 3S, offering a low-level access to the creation, modification and simulation of SIR 3S models.

On top of this core, higher-level functionality is provided, enabling more powerful and intuitive interactions with SIR 3S models. 

This layered architecture of the SIR 3S Toolkit ensures both flexibility and extensibility for advanced applications.
