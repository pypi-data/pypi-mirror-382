# JinDr - Local Docker Registry Manager

**JinDr** is a simple utility for deploying and managing a private docker
registry running on the local machine in a docker container.

Why?

In a nutshell ... to support building multi-platform docker images and provide a
simple test rig when you don't want to push a not-quite-ready docker build to
somewhere more exposed.

## Genesis

**JinDr** was developed at [Origin Energy](https://www.originenergy.com.au)
as part of the *Jindabyne* initiative. While not part of our core IP, it proved
valuable internally, and we're sharing it in the hope it's useful to others.

Kudos to Origin for fostering a culture that empowers its people
to build complex technology solutions in-house.

## Capabilities

**JinDr** can create and manage a fully functional docker registry, running in
a docker container with persistent storage in the local filesystem. All of the
normal docker commands (pull, push etc.) work as expected.

*JinDr** provides a CLI with subcommands to:

* start and stop the registry
* view and delete registry contents
* copy docker images to AWS ECR or another docker registry.

## Installation and Usage
