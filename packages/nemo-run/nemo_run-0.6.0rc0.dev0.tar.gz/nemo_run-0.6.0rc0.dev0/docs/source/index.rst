NeMo-Run Documentation
======================

NeMo-Run is a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution and management of Machine Learning experiments across various computing environments. NeMo Run has three core responsibilities:

1. `Configuration <./guides/configuration.html>`_
2. `Execution <./guides/execution.html>`_
3. `Management <./guides/management.html>`_

Please click into each link to learn more.
This is also the typical order Nemo Run users will follow to setup and launch experiments.

Install the Project
-------------------
To install the project, use the following command:

``pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Run.git``

To install Skypilot with optional features, use one of the following commands:

- To install Skypilot with Kubernetes support:

  ``pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Run.git[skypilot]``

- To install Skypilot with support for all cloud platforms:

  ``pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Run.git[skypilot-all]``

You can also manually install Skypilot from https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html

If using DGX Cloud Lepton, use the following command to install the Lepton CLI:

``pip install leptonai``

To authenticate with the DGX Cloud Lepton cluster, navigate to the **Settings > Tokens** page in the DGX Cloud Lepton UI and copy the ``lep login`` command shown on the page and run it in the terminal.

Make sure you have `pip` installed and configured properly.


Tutorials
---------

The ``hello_world`` tutorial series provides a comprehensive introduction to NeMo-Run, demonstrating its capabilities through a simple example. The tutorial covers:

- Configuring Python functions using ``Partial`` and ``Config`` classes.
- Executing configured functions locally and on remote clusters.
- Visualizing configurations with ``graphviz``.
- Creating and managing experiments using ``run.Experiment``.

You can find the tutorial series below:

1. `Part 1: Hello World <../../../examples/hello-world/hello_world.ipynb>`_
2. `Part 2: Hello Experiments <../../../examples/hello-world/hello_experiments.ipynb>`_
3. `Part 3: Hello Scripts <../../../examples/hello-world/hello_scripts.py>`_
