# An example of a progressive chat conversation.
#
# Passing a username or user ID in the first request results in saving a conversation thread
# in LWE.
#
# Future calls to LWE pass the returned conversation ID, which automatically:
#
# 1. Passes all previous messages in the next request
# 2. Stores the entire conversation in the conversation history
