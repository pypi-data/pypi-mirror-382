# A robust workflow that generates a short description of a person (persona)
# based on a a randomly selected set of characteristics.
#
# Inspired by https://github.com/daveshap/Automated_Consensus
#
# The characteristics are provided in a JSON file accessible from a URL. See
# the default characteristics file for the data structure -- it's easy to
# provide your own characteristics JSON file to generate different kinds of
# personas.
#
# The number of personas generated is controlled by the 'iterations' variable.
#
# Once a persona iteration file is generated, it will be skipped on future runs,
# Allowing selective removal and regeneration of personas.
