# Illustrates how to perform an iterative task until the user indicates they are done.
#
# This workflow continues to ask the user for tasks to give the LLM until they enter 'done'.
#
# For each round, it stores the response in a file suffixed with the unix timestamp.
#
# See iterative-task-include.yaml for the meat of the loop
