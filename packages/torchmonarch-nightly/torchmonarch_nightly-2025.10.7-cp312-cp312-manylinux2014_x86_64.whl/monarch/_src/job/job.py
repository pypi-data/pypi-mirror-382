    A job object represents a specification and set of machines that can be
    used to create monarch HostMeshes and run actors on them.

    A job object comprises a declarative specification for the job and
    optionally the job's *state*. The `apply()` operation applies the job's
    specification to the scheduler, creating or updating the job as
    required. If the job exists and there are no changes in its
    specification, `apply()` is a no-op. Once applied, we can query the
    job's *state*. The state of the job contains the set of hosts currently
    allocated, arranged into the requested host meshes. Conceptually, the
    state can be retrieved directly from the scheduler, but we may also
    cache snapshots of the state locally.

    The state is the interface to the job consumed by Monarch: Monarch
    bootstraps host meshes from the state alone, and is not concerned with
    any other aspect of the job.

    Conceptually, dynamic jobs (e.g., to enable consistently fast restarts,
    elasticity, etc.), Monarch can simply poll the state for changes. In
    practice we'd develop notification mechanisms so that polling isn't
    jobs can also be "templates". But the model also supports having the job
    job's *specification* is. The model allows for late resolution of some
    parts of the specification. For example, a job that does not specify a
    name may instead resolve the name on the first `apply()`. In this way,
    jobs can also be "templates". But the model also supports having the job
    refer to a *specific instance* by including the resolved job name in the
    specification itself.
