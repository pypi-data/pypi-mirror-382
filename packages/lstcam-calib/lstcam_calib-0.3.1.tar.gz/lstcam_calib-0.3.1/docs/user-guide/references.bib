abstract = {A simple but robust LED based light detector gain monitoring system capable of measuring gain to within a sensitivity of a fraction of a percent is presented. The absolute gain of the detector and its electronics can be measured with a systematic error from a fraction to a few percent depending on the photon-to-photon gain fluctuations. The method, based on intrinsic light and detector properties, does not require stringent mechanical or optical tolerances.}
