Calibration Data
================

Calibration data are written in files inside a specifically designed data-tree.

In order to bookkeep all files, their quality and their usage, specific meta-data
are produced for each file and stored in a database (this can be disabled using the option ``--no-db``
when calling the onsite tools)

In the following sections we describe the data-tree,  the database and the data models.
