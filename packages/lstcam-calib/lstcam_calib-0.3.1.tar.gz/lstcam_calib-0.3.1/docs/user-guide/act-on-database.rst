Change Database Documents
=========================


Database documents are automatically produced by the :ref:`onsite tools <onsite-command-line-tools>`
when producing the calibration files (this can be disabled with the option ``--no-db``).

All other direct actions to change the database documents must be performed with the
:ref:`database tools <database-tools>`.
