    MultiBaas API

    MultiBaas API provides a unified interface for interacting with blockchain networks. It enables applications to deploy and manage smart contracts, call contract methods, and query blockchain data through standard REST endpoints. The API also includes features for authentication, role-based access control, and integration with existing systems, allowing developers to build blockchain-powered applications without needing deep protocol-level expertise.
