# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-05 15:39:13 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Architecture (Max: 15 items)
- Service-oriented architecture with clear module boundaries
- Three-tier agent hierarchy: project → user → system
- Agent definitions use standardized JSON schema validation

## Coding Patterns Learned (Max: 15 items)
- Always use PathResolver for path operations, never hardcode paths
- SubprocessRunner utility for external command execution
- LoggerMixin provides consistent logging across all services

## Implementation Guidelines (Max: 15 items)
- Check docs/STRUCTURE.md before creating new files
- Follow existing import patterns: from claude_mpm.module import Class
- Use existing utilities instead of reimplementing functionality

## Domain-Specific Knowledge (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge accumulates here -->

## Effective Strategies (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (Max: 15 items)
- Don't modify Claude Code core functionality, only extend it
- Avoid duplicating code - check utils/ for existing implementations
- Never hardcode file paths, use PathResolver utilities

INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Create and run a direct test of the git fetching functionality to verify that all branches are being analyzed correctly with our fixes.

Requirements:
1. Create a test script that directly uses the DataFetcher class to fetch commits from a repository
2. Test with one of the EWTN repositories that we know has multiple branches (like ewtn-plus-foundation or hosanna-ui)
3. Test both with and without branch_patterns to show the difference
4. Count the commits found on each branch
5. Show clear output demonstrating whether all branches are being analyzed

The test should:
- Import the necessary modules from gitflow_analytics
- Create a DataFetcher instance
- Call the fetch methods directly with different branch_patterns configurations
- Print the results showing:
  - Which branches were analyzed
  - How many commits were found on each branch
  - Total commits with and without branch patterns

This will help us verify if our fixes are working correctly without running the full analysis pipeline.

Please create and run this test script to demonstrate the branch fetching behavior.
