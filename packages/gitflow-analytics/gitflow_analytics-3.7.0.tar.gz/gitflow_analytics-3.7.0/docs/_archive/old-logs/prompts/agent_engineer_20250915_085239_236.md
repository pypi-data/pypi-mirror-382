AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: engineer
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-05 15:39:13 | Auto-updated by: engineer -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Architecture (Max: 15 items)
- Service-oriented architecture with clear module boundaries
- Three-tier agent hierarchy: project â†’ user â†’ system
- Agent definitions use standardized JSON schema validation

## Coding Patterns Learned (Max: 15 items)
- Always use PathResolver for path operations, never hardcode paths
- SubprocessRunner utility for external command execution
- LoggerMixin provides consistent logging across all services

## Implementation Guidelines (Max: 15 items)
- Check docs/STRUCTURE.md before creating new files
- Follow existing import patterns: from claude_mpm.module import Class
- Use existing utilities instead of reimplementing functionality

## Domain-Specific Knowledge (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge accumulates here -->

## Effective Strategies (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (Max: 15 items)
- Don't modify Claude Code core functionality, only extend it
- Avoid duplicating code - check utils/ for existing implementations
- Never hardcode file paths, use PathResolver utilities

Initialize the gitflow-analytics project with comprehensive documentation and single-path workflows. The project is a Python package that analyzes Git repositories to generate developer productivity insights.

Structural Requirements:
- Objective: Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md with priority-ranked instructions
- Falsifiable Success Criteria:
  - CLAUDE.md exists with 4-tier priority system (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢âšª)
  - Single-path workflows documented for all operations
  - Development standards clearly defined
  - Tool configurations specified
  - Memory system initialized if not already present
  
Current Status:
- The project already has an extensive CLAUDE.md file with detailed instructions
- Project uses Python with pytest for testing, ruff/mypy/black for linting
- Has comprehensive documentation structure in docs/ directory
- Uses semantic-release for automated versioning
- Already has ML-enhanced commit categorization system

Required Actions:
1. REVIEW the existing CLAUDE.md comprehensively
2. REORGANIZE content using the 4-tier priority system:
   - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Security, data handling, core rules
   - ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT: Key workflows, architecture decisions  
   - ðŸŸ¢ STANDARD: Common operations, coding standards
   - âšª OPTIONAL: Nice-to-have features, future enhancements
3. ENHANCE with single-path principles:
   - ONE command for building/installation
   - ONE command for testing  
   - ONE command for linting/formatting
   - ONE command for deployment/release
4. ADD any missing critical instructions based on project analysis
5. CREATE a Priority Index section at the top for quick navigation
6. VALIDATE tool configurations match actual project setup
7. ENSURE memory system documentation is present
8. PERFORM holistic review for completeness

Testing Requirements: MANDATORY
- Verify all commands in CLAUDE.md are accurate
- Test that priority rankings make logical sense
- Ensure no duplicate or conflicting instructions
- Validate single-path principle is maintained throughout

Return with the reorganized CLAUDE.md content and a summary of changes made.
