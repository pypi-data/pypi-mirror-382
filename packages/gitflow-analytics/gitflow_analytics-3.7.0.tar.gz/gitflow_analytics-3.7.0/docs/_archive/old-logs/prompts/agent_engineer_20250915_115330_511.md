The previous fix for branch analysis didn't work for organization-wide discovery. We need to find where organization discovery creates repository configurations and ensure it passes through the branch_patterns configuration.

The issue:
- When using organization discovery (github.organization: EWTN-Global), the tool still only analyzes main branches
- The branch_patterns: ["*"] configuration is not being respected
- Our fix to _get_branches_to_analyze() works for individual repos but not organization discovery

Please:
1. Find where organization discovery creates repository configurations (likely in config.py or organization discovery code)
2. Ensure that branch_patterns from the analysis section are passed through to each discovered repository
3. If branch_patterns are not specified, default to ["*"] for complete coverage
4. Test the fix to confirm all branches are analyzed for organization-discovered repos

The configuration structure is:
```yaml
github:
  organization: EWTN-Global
  
analysis:
  branch_patterns: ["*"]  # This should apply to all discovered repos
```

Find and fix the code that handles organization discovery to properly pass through branch patterns.
