AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-05 15:36:32 | Auto-updated by: research -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Architecture (Max: 15 items)
- Service-oriented architecture with clear module boundaries
- Three-tier agent hierarchy: project → user → system
- Agent definitions use standardized JSON schema validation

## Coding Patterns Learned (Max: 15 items)
- Always use PathResolver for path operations, never hardcode paths
- SubprocessRunner utility for external command execution
- LoggerMixin provides consistent logging across all services

## Implementation Guidelines (Max: 15 items)
- Check docs/STRUCTURE.md before creating new files
- Follow existing import patterns: from claude_mpm.module import Class
- Use existing utilities instead of reimplementing functionality

## Domain-Specific Knowledge (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge accumulates here -->

## Effective Strategies (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (Max: 15 items)
- Don't modify Claude Code core functionality, only extend it
- Avoid duplicating code - check utils/ for existing implementations
- Never hardcode file paths, use PathResolver utilities

## Integration Points (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Key interfaces and integration patterns -->

## Performance Considerations (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Performance insights and optimization patterns -->

## Current Technical Context (Max: 15 items)
- EP-0001: Technical debt reduction in progress
- Target: 80% test coverage (current: 23.6%)
- Integration with Claude Code 1.0.60+ native agent framework

## Recent Learnings (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


The date is September 15, 2025. We need to investigate why GitFlow Analytics is only finding 3 commits across 96 EWTN-Global repositories for the 4-week period from August 18, 2025 to September 14, 2025.

Please investigate:
1. Check if the EWTN-Global repositories actually have recent activity in 2025
2. Look for any configuration issues that might be preventing proper commit detection
3. Check if repositories need to be cloned locally first for analysis
4. Verify if the GitHub token has proper permissions to access EWTN-Global repositories
5. Test with a longer time period (e.g., 52 weeks) to see if there's more historical data

The configuration shows:
- Organization: EWTN-Global
- 96 repositories discovered successfully
- Only 3 commits found in 4 weeks
- GitHub token is present in the config

Please provide:
- Analysis of actual repository activity levels
- Recommendations for getting more comprehensive data
- Any issues with repository access or cloning
- Suggested time period that would capture meaningful activity
