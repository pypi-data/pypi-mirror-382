## Project Context
gitflow-analytics: python (with javascript) standard application
- Main modules: gitflow_analytics, gitflow_analytics/classification, gitflow_analytics/metrics, gitflow_analytics/identity_llm
- Testing: Python unittest pattern
- Key patterns: Unit Testing

## Project Architecture
- Standard Application with python implementation
- Main directories: src, tests, docs
- Core modules: gitflow_analytics, gitflow_analytics/classification, gitflow_analytics/metrics, gitflow_analytics/identity_llm

## Coding Patterns Learned
- Python project: use type hints, follow PEP 8 conventions
- Project uses: Unit Testing

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use pip for dependency management
- Follow python unittest pattern
- Follow tests in /tests/ directory
- Key config files: pyproject.toml

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge for gitflow-analytics domain -->
- Key project terms: metrics, models, classification, gitflow

## Effective Strategies
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Avoid circular imports - use late imports when needed
- Don't ignore virtual environment - always activate before work
- Don't ignore database transactions in multi-step operations
- Avoid N+1 queries - use proper joins or prefetching

## Integration Points
- Sqlite database integration

## Performance Considerations
- Use list comprehensions over loops where appropriate
- Consider caching for expensive operations
- Index frequently queried columns
- Use connection pooling for database connections

## Current Technical Context
- Tech stack: python
- Data storage: sqlite
- Key dependencies: click>=8.1, gitpython>=3.1, pygithub>=2.0, tqdm>=4.65
- Documentation: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md

We need to clone all EWTN-Global repositories to properly analyze them. GitFlow Analytics expects them to be available locally.

Please:
1. Create a directory structure for the EWTN repositories (suggest: EWTN-test/repos/)
2. Clone the key EWTN-Global repositories that have recent activity
3. Focus on the most active ones first:
   - ewtn-plus-foundation
   - ewtn-plus-roku
   - ewtn-plus-api-gateway
   - ewtn-cms
   - cna-webapp
   - hosanna-ui
   - cna-frontend
   - cna-admin
   - acidigital-rebuild
   - acistampa

Use the GitHub token from EWTN-test/.env for authentication if needed.

After cloning, verify that:
- The repositories are accessible
- We can run git log commands on them
- Count the commits in the last 4-8 weeks to verify activity

This will allow GitFlow Analytics to properly analyze all branches and commits.
