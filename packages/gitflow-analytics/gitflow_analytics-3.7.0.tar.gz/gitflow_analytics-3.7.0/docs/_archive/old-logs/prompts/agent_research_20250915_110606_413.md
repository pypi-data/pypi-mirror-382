AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-05 15:36:32 | Auto-updated by: research -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Architecture (Max: 15 items)
- Service-oriented architecture with clear module boundaries
- Three-tier agent hierarchy: project → user → system
- Agent definitions use standardized JSON schema validation

## Coding Patterns Learned (Max: 15 items)
- Always use PathResolver for path operations, never hardcode paths
- SubprocessRunner utility for external command execution
- LoggerMixin provides consistent logging across all services

## Implementation Guidelines (Max: 15 items)
- Check docs/STRUCTURE.md before creating new files
- Follow existing import patterns: from claude_mpm.module import Class
- Use existing utilities instead of reimplementing functionality

## Domain-Specific Knowledge (Max: 15 items)

## Effective Strategies (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (Max: 15 items)
- Don't modify Claude Code core functionality, only extend it
- Avoid duplicating code - check utils/ for existing implementations
- Never hardcode file paths, use PathResolver utilities

INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


We need to double-check that GitFlow Analytics is capturing all activity from EWTN-Global repositories. The 8-week analysis found 280 commits across 21 active repositories out of 96 total.

Please thoroughly investigate:

1. Check several EWTN-Global repositories directly to verify actual commit counts for the period July 21 - September 14, 2025
2. Look at the local cloned repositories in EWTN-test/repos/ to see when they were last fetched/updated
3. Check if the GitFlow Analytics tool is properly fetching latest changes from remote repositories
4. Verify if there are any issues with:
   - Repository access permissions
   - Fetch timeouts for large repositories
   - Skipped repositories due to errors
   - Default branch detection issues

5. Compare the reported numbers against actual GitHub data:
   - Top repos reported: ewtn-plus-roku (74), ewtn-plus-api-gateway (70), ewtn-plus-foundation (48)
   - Verify these counts are accurate
   - Check some "0 commit" repos to confirm they really have no activity

6. Look for any configuration settings that might be limiting data collection:
   - Branch filters
   - Date range issues
   - Exclusion patterns that are too broad

Please provide:
- Verification of whether we're getting all commits
- Any gaps or missing data identified
- Root cause of any discrepancies
- Specific fixes needed to capture all activity
- Confirmation of actual commit counts vs reported
