Fix the bug in GitFlow Analytics where it only analyzes main/master branches instead of all branches when configured with branch_patterns.

The issue:
- GitFlow Analytics currently only analyzes the main/master branch by default
- Even when branch_patterns: ["*"] is configured, it still only analyzes main branches
- This causes it to miss 61% of commits that are on feature branches
- The bug is in the _get_branches_to_analyze() method in data_fetcher.py around lines 420-428

Requirements:
1. Find the _get_branches_to_analyze() method in the data fetcher
2. Fix it to respect the branch_patterns configuration when provided
3. When branch_patterns includes "*" or is not specified for organization discovery, analyze ALL branches
4. Ensure backward compatibility - if someone explicitly sets branch_patterns to ["main"], only analyze main
5. The fix should work with both individual repositories and organization-wide discovery

Test the implementation to ensure:
- All branches are analyzed when branch_patterns: ["*"] is configured
- Default behavior analyzes all branches for better coverage
- Specific branch patterns still work as expected

Please implement the fix and show the test results.
