Fix the line count exclusion issue in GitFlow Analytics where filtered stats are not being properly stored in the cache.

## Problem
The exclusion logic is correctly filtering files during git diff analysis, but the filtered line counts are not being stored in the database. The unfiltered values (105,861 for HOSANNA_UI and 131,144 for CNA_FRONTEND) are still being cached.

## Root Cause Analysis
I've traced the data flow and found the issue:

1. In data_fetcher.py line 376: `line_stats = self._calculate_commit_stats(commit)`
   - This correctly calculates filtered stats using the exclusion logic
   
2. In data_fetcher.py lines 384-385:
   ```python
   "lines_added": total_insertions,
   "lines_deleted": total_deletions,
   ```
   - The filtered stats are stored as `lines_added` and `lines_deleted`

3. BUT there's a problem: The `_calculate_commit_stats` function is being passed the GitPython commit object, but it needs the commit hash to run git commands.

4. In data_fetcher.py lines 1076-1077, when storing to cache:
   ```python
   "insertions": commit.get("lines_added", 0),
   "deletions": commit.get("lines_deleted", 0),
   ```
   - This correctly maps the fields for cache storage

## Required Fix
The issue is in the `_calculate_commit_stats` method call. It's being called with a GitPython commit object but the method expects to run git commands with a commit hash.

Look at lines 1360-1392 of data_fetcher.py where `_calculate_commit_stats` is defined. It needs a repo_path and commit_hash, but at line 376 it's being called with just `commit` (a GitPython object).

Fix this by:
1. Update the call at line 376 to pass the correct parameters: `self._calculate_commit_stats(str(repo_path), commit.hexsha)`
2. Verify the method signature and implementation are correct
3. Test that the filtered stats are now being properly calculated and stored

Please implement this fix and verify it works correctly.
