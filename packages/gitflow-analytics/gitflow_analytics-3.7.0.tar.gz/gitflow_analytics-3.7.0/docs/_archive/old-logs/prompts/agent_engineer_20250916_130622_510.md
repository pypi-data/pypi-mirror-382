<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 8KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Architecture (Max: 15 items)
- Service-oriented architecture with clear module boundaries
- Three-tier agent hierarchy: project → user → system
- Agent definitions use standardized JSON schema validation

## Coding Patterns Learned (Max: 15 items)
- Always use PathResolver for path operations, never hardcode paths
- SubprocessRunner utility for external command execution
- LoggerMixin provides consistent logging across all services

## Implementation Guidelines (Max: 15 items)
- Check docs/STRUCTURE.md before creating new files
- Follow existing import patterns: from claude_mpm.module import Class
- Use existing utilities instead of reimplementing functionality

## Domain-Specific Knowledge (Max: 15 items)

The GitFlow Analytics tool has two issues that need investigation and fixing:

1. **Rich terminal UI not displaying**: We added a sophisticated Rich-based progress display in src/gitflow_analytics/ui/progress_display.py, but it's not showing up during analysis. The CLI has --progress-style option (rich/simple) and it's integrated in the data_fetcher.py. Need to find why it's not activating.

2. **PM framework error**: Getting error "Failed to initialize PM framework: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'access_user'" - this appears to be related to PM integration configuration.

Please:
1. Check why the Rich progress display isn't being used (look at cli.py and data_fetcher.py integration)
2. Fix the PM framework initialization error (likely in the IntegrationOrchestrator)
3. Ensure the --progress-style rich option actually triggers the Rich display
4. Test that it works properly

The Rich display should show:
- Beautiful terminal UI with panels
- Real-time statistics
- Repository status tracking
- Memory and CPU monitoring

Make sure to test your fixes.
