AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-05 15:36:32 | Auto-updated by: research -->

<!-- MEMORY LIMITS: 16KB max | 10 sections max | 15 items per section -->

## Project Architecture (Max: 15 items)
- Service-oriented architecture with clear module boundaries
- Three-tier agent hierarchy: project → user → system
- Agent definitions use standardized JSON schema validation

## Coding Patterns Learned (Max: 15 items)
- Always use PathResolver for path operations, never hardcode paths
- SubprocessRunner utility for external command execution
- LoggerMixin provides consistent logging across all services

## Implementation Guidelines (Max: 15 items)
- Check docs/STRUCTURE.md before creating new files
- Follow existing import patterns: from claude_mpm.module import Class
- Use existing utilities instead of reimplementing functionality

## Domain-Specific Knowledge (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Agent-specific knowledge accumulates here -->

## Effective Strategies (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Successful approaches discovered through experience -->

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (Max: 15 items)
- Don't modify Claude Code core functionality, only extend it
- Avoid duplicating code - check utils/ for existing implementations
- Never hardcode file paths, use PathResolver utilities

## Integration Points (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Key interfaces and integration patterns -->

## Performance Considerations (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Performance insights and optimization patterns -->

## Current Technical Context (Max: 15 items)
- EP-0001: Technical debt reduction in progress
- Target: 80% test coverage (current: 23.6%)
- Integration with Claude Code 1.0.60+ native agent framework

## Recent Learnings (Max: 15 items)
<!-- Most recent discoveries and insights -->


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Analyze why the GitFlow Analytics tool is only detecting 3 commits across 96 EWTN-Global repositories for a 4-week period (2025-08-18 to 2025-09-14). This seems unusually low for an active organization.

Please investigate:
1. Check a few of the EWTN-Global repositories directly on GitHub to verify if there are actually commits in this time period
2. Review the configuration in EWTN-test/config.yaml for any settings that might be filtering out commits
3. Look at the exclude patterns and identity mappings to see if they're too restrictive
4. Check if the date range calculation might be incorrect (note the dates shown: 2025-08-18 to 2025-09-14)
5. Examine if there's an issue with the organization discovery process or repository access

The configuration shows:
- Organization: EWTN-Global  
- 96 repositories discovered
- Only 3 commits found across all repos
- Repositories with commits: DAT_CONSUMER (1), EWTN_PLUS_FOUNDATION (2)

Please provide:
- Root cause analysis of why so few commits are detected
- Specific configuration changes needed to capture all commits
- Any issues with the date range or time period calculation
- Recommendations for getting a proper 4-week analysis
