# Story Points Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
The EWTN config at `~/Projects/EWTN/gfa/config.yaml` was not properly configured to track story points. The configuration was missing the JIRA integration section needed to fetch story points from JIRA tickets.

## Solution
Updated `configs/ewtn-test-config.yaml` with proper story points tracking configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added JIRA Integration Configuration
```yaml
# JIRA integration for story points extraction
jira:
  access_user: "${JIRA_ACCESS_USER}"
  access_token: "${JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
  base_url: "https://ewtn.atlassian.net"

jira_integration:
  enabled: true
  fetch_story_points: true
  story_point_fields:
    - "customfield_10063"  # Story Points (primary field from test script)
    - "customfield_10016"  # Story point estimate (backup field)
    - "Story Points"       # Field name fallback
    - "timeestimate"       # Remaining Estimate
    - "timeoriginalestimate"  # Original estimate
```

### 2. Fixed Story Point Pattern Configuration
Moved from nested `story_points.patterns` to top-level `story_point_patterns` in the analysis section:

```yaml
analysis:
  # Story point extraction patterns (text-based patterns for commit messages)
  story_point_patterns:
    - "(?:story\\s*points?|sp|pts?)\\s*[:=]\\s*(\\d+)"  # SP: 5, story points = 3
    - "\\[(\\d+)\\s*(?:sp|pts?|points?)\\]"  # [3sp], [5 pts], [3 points]
    - "\\((\\d+)\\s*(?:story\\s*points?|sp|pts?)\\)"  # (5 story points), (3 sp)
    - "#(\\d+)sp"  # #3sp
    - "estimate:\\s*(\\d+)"  # estimate: 5
    - "\\bSP(\\d+)\\b"  # SP5, SP13
    - "points?:\\s*(\\d+)"  # points: 8
```

### 3. Enhanced Pattern Coverage
Added patterns to catch more story point formats:
- `[3 points]` - brackets with "points" word
- `(5 story points)` - parentheses format
- Improved existing patterns for better matching

## Test Results
✅ **Configuration Loading**: PASS  
✅ **Story Point Extractor**: PASS (8/8 patterns work)  
✅ **JIRA Integration Setup**: PASS  

## How Story Points Tracking Works

### Two-Phase Approach
1. **Text-based extraction**: Extracts story points from commit messages using regex patterns
2. **JIRA integration**: Fetches story points from JIRA tickets referenced in commits

### Story Point Sources (in priority order)
1. **JIRA tickets** - Most authoritative source
   - Uses configured `story_point_fields` to find story points in JIRA
   - Matches ticket references in commit messages (e.g., "RMVP-1030")
   
2. **Commit messages** - Fallback for text-based extraction
   - Uses `story_point_patterns` to extract from commit text
   - Useful when JIRA integration is unavailable or tickets don't have story points

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Set Environment Variables
```bash
export JIRA_ACCESS_USER="your-email@ewtn.com"
export JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token"
```

### 2. Run Analysis
```bash
gitflow-analytics analyze --config configs/ewtn-test-config.yaml --weeks 4
```

### 3. Check Reports
Story points will appear in:
- **Summary reports**: Total story points per developer/project
- **Developer reports**: Story points breakdown by developer
- **Weekly metrics**: Story points trends over time
- **Comprehensive export**: Full story points data in JSON format

## Verification
Run the test script to verify configuration:
```bash
python3 test_config_story_points.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Copy the working configuration to your actual config location
2. Set up JIRA credentials in environment variables
3. Run analysis to generate reports with story points data
4. Review reports to ensure story points are being tracked correctly

## Configuration Files
- **Working config**: `configs/ewtn-test-config.yaml`
- **Test script**: `test_config_story_points.py`
- **Original issue**: Missing JIRA integration in story points configuration
