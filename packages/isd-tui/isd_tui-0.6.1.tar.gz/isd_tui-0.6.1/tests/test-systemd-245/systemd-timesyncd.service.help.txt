NAME
       systemd-timesyncd.service, systemd-timesyncd - Network Time Synchronization

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-timesyncd.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-timesyncd

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to synchronize the local system clock with a remote Network Time
       Protocol server. It also saves the local time to disk every time the clock has been synchronized and uses this to
       possibly advance the system realtime clock on subsequent reboots to ensure it monotonically advances even if the system
       lacks a battery-buffered RTC chip.

       The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock
       for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

       The NTP servers contacted are determined from the global settings in timesyncd.conf(5), the per-link static settings in
       .network files, and the per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP. See systemd.network(5) for more details.

       timedatectl(1)'s set-ntp command may be used to enable and start, or disable and stop this service.

       timedatectl(1)'s timesync-status or show-timesync command can be used to show the current status of this service.

FILES
       /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock
           The modification time of this file indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the
           systemd build date, in case synchronization was not possible).

       /run/systemd/timesync/synchronized
           A file that is touched on each successful synchronization, to assist systemd-time-wait-sync and other applications
           to detecting synchronization events.
