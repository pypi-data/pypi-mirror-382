# OpenAleph Procrastinate

The most dumbest task queue for [OpenAleph](https://openaleph.org) based on [procrastinate](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Documentation

https://openaleph.org/docs/lib/openaleph-procrastinate

## Development

This package is using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependencies management, so first [install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Clone this repository to a local destination.

Within the repo directory, run

    poetry install --with dev

This installs a few development dependencies, including [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) which needs to be registered:

    poetry run pre-commit install

Before creating a commit, this checks for correct code formatting (isort, black) and some other useful stuff (see: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

### requirements.txt

To lock dependencies, we use `poetry lock` and a pre-commit hook that exports the lockfile to `requirements.txt`. Always make sure to check in the lockfile when adding packages.
