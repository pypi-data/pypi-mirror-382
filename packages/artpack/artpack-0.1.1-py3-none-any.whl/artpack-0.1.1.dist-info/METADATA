Name: artpack
Version: 0.1.1
Summary: Create data that displays generative art when mapped into a 'plotnine' plot. Functionality includes specialized data frame creation for geometric shapes, tools that define artistic color palettes, tools for geometrically transforming data, and other miscellaneous tools that are helpful when using 'plotnine' for generative art.

# artpack

Python port of the R package [artpack](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=artpack), bringing generative art color palettes to the Python ecosystem.

## About

artpack provides curated color palettes designed for generative art and data visualization. This is a work-in-progress port of the original R package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install artpack-py
```

## Quick Start

```python
from artpack import art_pals

# Get 5 colors from the ocean palette
colors = art_pals("ocean", n=5)
print(colors)
# ['#12012E', '#144267', '#15698C', '#0695AA', '#156275']

# Reverse the palette
colors_rev = art_pals("ocean", n=5, direction = "reverse")

# Randomize color order
colors_random = art_pals("rainbow", n = 10, randomize = True)
```

## Available Palettes

`"arctic"`, `"beach"`, `"bw"`, `"brood"`, `"cosmos"`, `"explorer"`, `"gemstones"`, `"grays"`, `"icecream"`, `"imagination"`, `"majestic"`, `"nature"`, `"neon"`, `"ocean"`, `"plants"`, `"rainbow"`, `"sunnyside"`, `"super"`

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - Currently porting core functionality from the R version. More features coming soon!

**Currently implemented:**
- âœ… Color palette generation (`art_pals()`)
- âœ… 100% test coverage
- âœ… CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Roadmap:**
- Additional color palette tools (Functions that help with color-related tasks.)
- Asset creation (Functions that help with making data for generative art.)
- Geometric testing tools (Functions that help with geometric/spatial analysis for generative art.)
- Grouping tools (Functions that help with grouping generative art data.)
- Sequencing tools (Functions that help with numeric sequencing.)
- Transformation tools (Functions that help with transforming existing generative art data.)
