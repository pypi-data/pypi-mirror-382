    """Abstract interface for a parametrization of a volume. Specifically,
    the cryo-EM image formation process typically starts with a *scattering potential*.
    "Volumes" and "scattering potentials" in cryoJAX are synonymous.

    !!! info
        In, `cryojax`, potentials should be built in units of *inverse length squared*,
        $[L]^{-2}$. This rescaled potential is defined to be

        $$U(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{2 m e}{\\hbar^2} V(\\mathbf{r}),$$

        where $V$ is the electrostatic potential energy, $\\mathbf{r}$ is a positional
        coordinate, $m$ is the electron mass, and $e$ is the electron charge.

        For a single atom, this rescaled potential has the advantage that under usual
        scattering approximations (i.e. the first-born approximation), the
        fourier transform of this quantity is closely related to tabulated electron scattering
        factors. In particular, for a single atom with scattering factor $f^{(e)}(\\mathbf{q})$
        and scattering vector $\\mathbf{q}$, its rescaled potential is equal to

        $$U(\\mathbf{r}) = 4 \\pi \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[f^{(e)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} / 2)](\\mathbf{r}),$$

        where $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = 2 \\mathbf{q}$ is the wave vector coordinate and
        $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ is the inverse fourier transform operator in the convention

        $$\\mathcal{F}[f](\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = \\int d^3\\mathbf{r} \\ \\exp(2\\pi i \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}) f(\\mathbf{r}).$$

        The rescaled potential $U$ gives the following time-independent schrodinger equation
        for the scattering problem,

        $$(\\nabla^2 + k^2) \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = - U(\\mathbf{r}) \\psi(\\mathbf{r}),$$

        where $k$ is the incident wavenumber of the electron beam.
