# GENERAL COMMENTS
# - The example shows that it is possible to call the same input variable multiple times with different
#   settings
# - The file is quite verbose, but I feel it's more comprehensible this way (and also easier for me to 
#   read in yori
# - the order of the elements in the variable_settings it's interchangeable (I guess...)
# 
# MASKS MEMO (when the file sample_input_v1.7.nc is used):
# Test_Mask_1 is a matrix of only 0
# Test_Mask_2 is a matrix filled with random 0 and 1
