        This field works with the initialStoredLabware field in a complex way.

          - It is not specified, and initialStoredLabware is not specified, in which case the stacker will start empty
          - It is not specified, and initialStoredLabware is specified, in which case the contents of the stacker are entirely
            determined by initialStoredLabware.
          - It is specified, and initialStoredLabware is specified, in which case the length of initialStoredLabware must be

        A list of IDs that should be initially stored in the stacker.

        If specified, the first element of the list is the labware on the physical bottom that will be the first labware retrieved.

        This is a complex field. The following must be true for the field to be valid:
        - If this field is specified, then either initialCount must not be specified, or this field must have exactly initalCount elements
        - Each element must contain an id for each corresponding labware details field (i.e. if lidLabware is specified, each element must have
          a lidLabwareId) and must not contain an id for a corresponding labware details field that is not specified (i.e., if adapterLabware
          is not specified, each element must not have an adapterLabwareId).

        The behavior of the command depends on the values of both this field and initialCount.
        - If this field is not specified and initialCount is not specified, the command will create the maximum number of labware objects
          the stacker can hold according to the labware pool specifications.
        - If this field is not specified and initialCount is specified to be 0, the command will create 0 labware objects and the stacker will be empty.
        - If this field is not specified and initialCount is specified to be non-0, the command will create initialCount labware objects of
          each specified labware type (primary, lid, and adapter), with appropriate positions, and arbitrary IDs, loaded into the stacker
        - If this field is specified (and therefore initialCount is not specified or is specified to be the length of this field) then the
          command will create labware objects with the IDs specified in this field and appropriate positions, loaded into the stacker.

        Behavior is also different depending on whether the labware identified by ID in this field exist or not. Either all labware specified
        in this field must exist, or all must not exist.

        Further,
        - If the labware exist, they must be of the same type as identified in the primaryLabware field.
        - If the labware exist and the adapterLabware field is specified, each labware must be currently loaded on a labware of the same kind as
          specified in the adapterLabware field, and that labware must be loaded off-deck
        - If the labware exist and the adapterLabware field is not specified, each labware must be currently loaded off deck directly
        - If the labware exist and the lidLabware field is specified, each labware must currently have a loaded lid of the same kind as specified
          in the lidLabware field
        - If the labware exist and the lidLabware field is not specified, each labware must not currently have a lid
        - If the labware exist, they must have nothing loaded underneath them or above them other than what is mentioned above

        If all the above are true, when this command executes the labware will be immediately moved into InStackerHopper. If any of the above
        are not true, analysis will fail.
