1. Manage agent prompts with versioning using AgentLab
2. Automatically upload new prompts if they don't exist  
3. Run evaluations using the managed prompts
4. Allow easy prompt updates and version management

The book is famous for introducing the number 42 as 'the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.' Here's a funny story: Douglas Adams wrote much of it in a hotel room in Innsbruck, Austria, after his editor literally locked him in until he finished it due to missed deadlines!

Interesting backstory: Room 101 was named after a real BBC meeting room where Orwell had boring meetings! The telescreen concept was inspired by early BBC television. Originally, Orwell wanted to call it '1980' but his publisher thought that was too close to publication date, so he reversed '1948' to get '1984.'
