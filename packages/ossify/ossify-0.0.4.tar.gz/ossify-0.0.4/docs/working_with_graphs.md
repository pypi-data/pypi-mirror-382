# Working with Graphs

!!! warning "AI-Generated Documentation"

Graph layers represent general network structures with vertices and edges. Unlike skeletons, graphs can have cycles, multiple connected components, and any connectivity pattern. They're commonly used for level-2 graph data from connectomics pipelines.

!!! note "Shared Features"
    Graphs inherit many common features from the `PointMixin` class. For information about features, masking, transformations, spatial queries, and cross-layer mapping, see [Shared Layer Features](shared_layer_features.md).

!!! info "Graphs vs Skeletons"
    **Graphs** are general network structures that can have cycles and multiple components. **Skeletons** are specialized tree structures (no cycles, single component, with a defined root). See [Working with Skeletons](working_with_skeletons.md) for tree-specific analysis.

## What is a Graph Layer?

A `GraphLayer` contains:
- **Vertices**: 3D coordinates of network nodes
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices (can form cycles)
- **Network properties**: Connectivity analysis, distance calculations between arbitrary vertices

## Inspecting Graph Layers

### Quick Overview with `describe()`

The `describe()` method provides a comprehensive summary of graph layers, showing vertex/edge counts, features, and connections to other layers:

```python
# Individual graph layer
cell.graph.describe()
```

**Output:**
```
# Cell: my_neuron
# Layer: graph (GraphLayer)  
├── 45 vertices, 67 edges
├── features: [node_type, confidence]
└── Links: []
```

The output shows:
- **Cell context**: Which cell this graph belongs to
- **Layer type**: Confirms this is a GraphLayer
- **Metrics**: Vertex and edge counts  
- **features**: Available data columns beyond spatial coordinates
- **Links**: Connections to other layers (`<->` = bidirectional, `→` = unidirectional)

### Layer Manager Overview

You can also inspect all morphological layers at once using `cell.layers.describe()` to see how your graph fits with other layers like skeletons and meshes.

## Creating Graph Layers

### Basic Graph Creation

```python
import numpy as np
import ossify

# Create a graph with a cycle
vertices = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0],    # Vertex 0
    [1, 0, 0],    # Vertex 1
    [2, 0, 0],    # Vertex 2
    [1, 1, 0],    # Vertex 3
])

edges = np.array([
    [0, 1],  # Edge from 0 to 1
    [1, 2],  # Edge from 1 to 2
    [2, 3],  # Edge from 2 to 3
    [3, 0],  # Edge from 3 to 0 (creates cycle)
])

# Add to cell
cell = ossify.Cell(name="graph_example")
cell.add_graph(vertices=vertices, edges=edges)

print(f"Graph has {cell.graph.n_vertices} vertices and {len(cell.graph.edges)} edges")
```

### Graph with features

```python
# Add vertex features during creation
compartment_features = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])  # Different compartments

cell.add_graph(
    vertices=vertices,
    edges=edges,
    features={"compartment": compartment_features}
)
```

### Multiple Connected Components

```python
# Graph with disconnected components
vertices = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0],    # Component 1
    [5, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0],    # Component 2 (disconnected)
])

edges = np.array([
    [0, 1],  # Component 1
    [2, 3],  # Component 2
    # No edges between components
])

cell.add_graph(vertices=vertices, edges=edges)
```

## Graph-Specific Features

### Edge Access and Connectivity

```python
graph = cell.graph

# Access edge data
edges_array = graph.edges               # Edges with vertex indices
edges_positional = graph.edges_positional  # Edges with positional indices
edge_df = graph.edge_df                # Edges as DataFrame

print(f"Number of edges: {len(graph.edges)}")
```

### Graph Representation as Sparse Matrices

```python
# Different sparse matrix representations for analysis
csgraph = graph.csgraph                    # Weighted by Euclidean distance (directed)
csgraph_binary = graph.csgraph_binary      # Unweighted/binary (directed)
csgraph_undirected = graph.csgraph_undirected  # Weighted (undirected)
csgraph_binary_undirected = graph.csgraph_binary_undirected  # Binary (undirected)

# Use with scipy.sparse.csgraph functions
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import connected_components
n_components, features = connected_components(graph.csgraph_undirected)
print(f"Number of connected components: {n_components}")
```

### Distance Calculations Between Arbitrary Vertices

```python
# Calculate shortest path distances between any vertices
sources = graph.vertex_index[:2]  # First two vertices
targets = graph.vertex_index[2:4]  # Next two vertices

distances = graph.distance_between(
    sources=sources,
    targets=targets,
    as_positional=False,    # Using vertex indices
    limit=10.0             # Maximum distance to consider
)
print(f"Distance matrix shape: {distances.shape}")
print(f"Distances:\n{distances}")

# Find shortest path between two vertices
path = graph.path_between(
    source=graph.vertex_index[0],
    target=graph.vertex_index[2],
    as_positional=False,
    as_vertices=False      # Return vertex indices, not coordinates
)
print(f"Path from vertex {graph.vertex_index[0]} to {graph.vertex_index[2]}: {path}")
```

### Network Analysis with External Libraries

```python
# Convert to NetworkX for advanced network analysis
import networkx as nx

# Create NetworkX graph from edges
G = nx.from_edgelist(graph.edges)

# Network properties
print(f"Number of connected components: {nx.number_connected_components(G)}")
print(f"Is connected: {nx.is_connected(G)}")
print(f"Average clustering: {nx.average_clustering(G)}")

# Centrality measures
betweenness = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)

# Add centralities as features
graph.add_feature(list(betweenness.values()), name="betweenness")
graph.add_feature(list(degree_centrality.values()), name="degree_centrality")
```

### Annotation Aggregation

```python
# Aggregate point annotations to graph vertices
# (requires annotations in the cell)
if "synapses" in cell.annotations.names:
    synapse_counts = graph.map_annotations_to_feature(
        annotation="synapses",
        distance_threshold=1.0,     # Distance threshold for aggregation
        agg="count",                # Count synapses near each vertex
        chunk_size=1000,            # Process in chunks for efficiency
        validate=False,             # Skip mapping validation
        agg_direction="undirected"  # Consider all nearby edges
    )
    
    # Add as feature
    graph.add_feature(synapse_counts, name="synapse_count")

    # Custom aggregation functions
    synapse_stats = graph.map_annotations_to_feature(
        annotation="synapses",
        distance_threshold=2.0,
        agg={
            "mean_confidence": ("confidence", "mean"),
            "max_size": ("size", "max"),
            "synapse_density": ("size", lambda x: len(x) / 2.0)  # Custom function
        }
    )
```

### Working with Level-2 Graph Data

```python
# Common pattern for connectomics L2 graphs
# L2 graphs often have many vertices and represent spatial connectivity

# Large graph from connectomics data
import pandas as pd

# Typical L2 vertex data
l2_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'l2_id': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
    'rep_coord_nm_x': [1000, 2000, 3000, 1500, 2500],
    'rep_coord_nm_y': [1000, 1000, 1000, 2000, 2000],
    'rep_coord_nm_z': [500, 500, 500, 500, 500],
    'size_nm3': [1e6, 1.5e6, 0.8e6, 1.2e6, 0.9e6]
})

# L2 edges (fewer edges than complete graph)
l2_edges = np.array([
    [100, 101],
    [101, 102], 
    [101, 103],
    [103, 104]
])

cell.add_graph(
    vertices=l2_data,
    edges=l2_edges,
    spatial_columns=['rep_coord_nm_x', 'rep_coord_nm_y', 'rep_coord_nm_z'],
    vertex_index='l2_id',
    features={'volume': 'size_nm3'}
)

print(f"L2 graph vertex indices: {cell.graph.vertex_index}")
```

## Graph Analysis Patterns

### Connectivity Analysis

```python
# Find isolated vertices (no edges)
degrees = np.array([len(nx.neighbors(G, v)) for v in G.nodes()])
isolated_vertices = graph.vertex_index[degrees == 0]
print(f"Isolated vertices: {isolated_vertices}")

# Find high-degree vertices (hubs)
high_degree_threshold = np.percentile(degrees, 90)
hub_vertices = graph.vertex_index[degrees > high_degree_threshold]
print(f"Hub vertices: {hub_vertices}")
```

### Subgraph Extraction

```python
# Extract subgraph around specific vertices
center_vertices = graph.vertex_index[:3]
subgraph_mask = graph.vertex_index.isin(center_vertices)

# Expand to include neighbors
for center in center_vertices:
    neighbors = list(G.neighbors(center))
    neighbor_mask = graph.vertex_index.isin(neighbors)
    subgraph_mask = subgraph_mask | neighbor_mask

# Create masked subgraph
subgraph = graph.apply_mask(subgraph_mask, as_positional=False)
print(f"Subgraph has {subgraph.n_vertices} vertices")
```

### Distance-based Queries

```python
# Find all vertices within a certain graph distance
center_vertex = graph.vertex_index[0]
max_distance = 3

# Calculate distances from center
distances = graph.distance_between(
    sources=[center_vertex],
    targets=graph.vertex_index,
    as_positional=False,
    limit=max_distance
)

# Find vertices within distance
nearby_mask = distances[0] <= max_distance
nearby_vertices = graph.vertex_index[nearby_mask]
print(f"Vertices within distance {max_distance}: {nearby_vertices}")
```
