# Working with Meshes

!!! warning "AI-Generated Documentation"

Mesh layers in ossify represent surface data as collections of vertices and triangular faces. They're ideal for representing the 3D surface of cellular structures like neuron soma, dendrites, or entire cell bodies.

!!! note "Shared Features"
    Meshes inherit many common features from the `PointMixin` class. For information about features, masking, transformations, spatial queries, and cross-layer mapping, see [Shared Layer Features](shared_layer_features.md).

## What is a Mesh Layer?

A `MeshLayer` contains:
- **Vertices**: 3D coordinates of points on the surface
- **Faces**: Triangular faces connecting vertices (as indices)  
- **Surface properties**: Face connectivity, area calculations, trimesh integration

## Inspecting Mesh Layers

### Quick Overview with `describe()`

The `describe()` method provides a comprehensive summary of mesh layers, showing vertex/face counts, features, and connections to other layers:

```python
# Individual mesh layer
cell.mesh.describe()
```

**Output:**
```
# Cell: my_neuron  
# Layer: mesh (MeshLayer)
├── 2847 vertices, 5691 faces
├── features: [compartment, surface_area]
└── Links: skeleton <-> mesh
```

The output shows:
- **Cell context**: Which cell this mesh belongs to
- **Layer type**: Confirms this is a MeshLayer  
- **Metrics**: Vertex and face counts
- **features**: Available data columns beyond spatial coordinates
- **Links**: Connections to other layers (`<->` = bidirectional, `→` = unidirectional)

### Layer Manager Overview

You can also inspect all morphological layers at once using `cell.layers.describe()` to see how your mesh fits with other layers like skeletons and graphs.

## Creating Mesh Layers

### Basic Mesh Creation

```python
import numpy as np
import ossify

# Create a simple tetrahedron
vertices = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0],    # Vertex 0
    [1, 0, 0],    # Vertex 1  
    [0, 1, 0],    # Vertex 2
    [0, 0, 1],    # Vertex 3
])

# Faces as triangles (indices into vertices)
faces = np.array([
    [0, 1, 2],    # Bottom face
    [0, 1, 3],    # Side face 1
    [0, 2, 3],    # Side face 2  
    [1, 2, 3],    # Top face
])

# Add to cell
cell = ossify.Cell(name="mesh_example")
cell.add_mesh(vertices=vertices, faces=faces)

print(f"Mesh has {cell.mesh.n_vertices} vertices and {len(cell.mesh.faces)} faces")
```

### Mesh with features

```python
# Add vertex features during creation
region_features = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])  # Two regions

cell.add_mesh(
    vertices=vertices,
    faces=faces,
    features={"region": region_features}
)
```

## Mesh-Specific Properties

### Face Data Access

```python
mesh = cell.mesh

# Access face data (unique to meshes)
faces_array = mesh.faces               # Faces with vertex indices
faces_positional = mesh.faces_positional  # Faces with positional indices

print(f"Number of faces: {len(mesh.faces)}")
```

### Surface Area Calculations

```python
# Total surface area
total_area = mesh.surface_area()

# Surface area for specific vertices
vertex_subset = mesh.vertex_index[:2]  # First two vertices
partial_area = mesh.surface_area(
    vertices=vertex_subset,
    as_positional=False,     # Using vertex indices
    inclusive=True           # Include faces touching any vertex
)

# Surface area for faces fully covered by vertices
exclusive_area = mesh.surface_area(
    vertices=vertex_subset,
    as_positional=False,
    inclusive=False         # Only faces with all vertices in subset
)
```

### Trimesh Integration

Ossify integrates with the [trimesh](https://trimsh.org/) library for advanced mesh operations:

```python
# Get as trimesh object
tmesh = mesh.as_trimesh

# Trimesh provides many useful properties
print(f"Is watertight: {tmesh.is_watertight}")
print(f"Volume: {tmesh.volume}")
print(f"Center of mass: {tmesh.center_mass}")

# Get edges from trimesh
edge_indices = mesh.edges               # With vertex indices
edge_positions = mesh.edges_positional  # With positional indices
```

### Graph Representation

Meshes can be treated as graphs for connectivity analysis:

```python
# Get sparse graph representation for mesh connectivity
csgraph = mesh.csgraph  # Weighted by edge lengths

# Get edge connectivity (derived from faces)
edge_indices = mesh.edges               # With vertex indices
edge_positions = mesh.edges_positional  # With positional indices
```

## Key Mesh-Specific Methods

### Mesh Creation
- `cell.add_mesh(vertices, faces, features=None, spatial_columns=None, vertex_index=None)` - Add mesh to cell

### Mesh-Specific Properties
- `mesh.faces` - Face indices using vertex indices
- `mesh.faces_positional` - Face indices using positional indices
- `mesh.surface_area(vertices=None, as_positional=True, inclusive=False)` - Calculate surface area
- `mesh.as_trimesh` - Get as trimesh.Trimesh object
- `mesh.as_tuple` - Get (vertices, faces) tuple for external libraries
- `mesh.edges` - Edge connectivity derived from faces (with vertex indices)
- `mesh.edges_positional` - Edge connectivity derived from faces (with positional indices)
- `mesh.csgraph` - Sparse graph representation for connectivity analysis
