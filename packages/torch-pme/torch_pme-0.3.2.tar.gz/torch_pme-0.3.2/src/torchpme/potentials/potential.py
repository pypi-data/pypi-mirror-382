class Potential(torch.nn.Module):
    r"""
    Base interface for a pair potential energy function between monopoles.

    The class provides the interface to compute a short-range and long-range functions
    in real space (such that :math:`V(r)=V_{\mathrm{SR}}(r)+V_{\mathrm{LR}}(r)` ), as
    well as a reciprocal-space version of the long-range component
    :math:`\hat{V}_{\mathrm{LR}}(k))` ).

    Derived classes can decide to implement a subset of these functionalities (e.g.
    providing only the real-space potential :math:`V(r)`). Internal state variables and
    parameters in derived classes should be defined in the ``__init__``  method.

    This base class also provides parameters to set the length scale associated with the
    range separation (``smearing``), and a cutoff function that can be optionally
    set to zero out the potential *inside* a short-range ``exclusion_radius``. This is
    often useful when combining ``torch-pme``-based ML models with local models that are
    better suited to describe the structure within a local cutoff.

    Note that a :class:`Potential` class can also be used inside a
    :class:`KSpaceFilter`, see :func:`Potential.kernel_from_k_sq`.

    :param smearing: The length scale associated with the switching between
        :math:`V_{\mathrm{SR}}(r)` and :math:`V_{\mathrm{LR}}(r)`
    :param exclusion_radius: A length scale that defines a *local environment* within
        which the potential should be smoothly zeroed out, as it will be described by a
        separate model.
    :param exclusion_degree: Controls the sharpness of the transition in the cutoff function
        applied within the ``exclusion_radius``. The cutoff is computed as a raised cosine
        with exponent ``exclusion_degree``
