    Base calculator for the torch interface. Based on a
    :class:`Potential` class, it computes the value of a potential
    by either directly summing over neighbor atoms, or by combining
    a local part computed in real space, and a long-range part computed
    in the Fourier domain. The class can be used directly to evaluate
    the real-space part of the potential, or subclassed providing
    a strategy to evalate the long-range contribution in k-space
    (see e.g. :class:`PMECalculator` or :class:`EwaldCalculator`).

    :func:`Calculator._compute_kspace`.
