class PMECalculator(Calculator):
    r"""
    Potential using a particle mesh-based Ewald (PME).

    Scaling as :math:`\mathcal{O}(NlogN)` with respect to the number of particles
    :math:`N` used as a reference to test faster implementations.

    For getting reasonable values for the ``smaring`` of the potential class and  the
    ``mesh_spacing`` based on a given accuracy for a specific structure you should use
    :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_pme`. This function will also find the optimal
    ``cutoff`` for the  **neighborlist**.

    .. hint::

        For a training exercise it is recommended only run a tuning procedure with
        :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_pme` for the largest system in your dataset.

    :param potential: A :class:`torchpme.potentials.Potential` object that implements
        the evaluation of short and long-range potential terms. The ``smearing``
        parameter of the potential determines the split between real and k-space
        regions. For a :class:`torchpme.CoulombPotential` it corresponds to the
        smearing of the atom-centered Gaussian used to split the Coulomb potential into
        the short- and long-range parts. A reasonable value for most systems is to set
        it to ``1/5`` times the neighbor list cutoff.
    :param mesh_spacing: Value that determines the umber of Fourier-space grid points
        that will be used along each axis. If set to None, it will automatically be set
        to half of ``smearing``.
    :param interpolation_nodes: The number ``n`` of nodes used in the interpolation per
        coordinate axis. The total number of interpolation nodes in 3D will be ``n^3``.
        In general, for ``n`` nodes, the interpolation will be performed by piecewise
        polynomials of degree ``n - 1`` (e.g. ``n = 4`` for cubic interpolation).
        Only the values ``3, 4, 5, 6, 7`` are supported.
    :param full_neighbor_list: If set to :obj:`True`, a "full" neighbor list
        is expected as input. This means that each atom pair appears twice. If
        set to :obj:`False`, a "half" neighbor list is expected.
    :param prefactor: electrostatics prefactor; see :ref:`prefactors` for details and
        common values.
