    Potential using a particle-particle particle-mesh based Ewald (P3M).

    For getting reasonable values for the ``smearing`` of the potential class and  the
    ``mesh_spacing`` based on a given accuracy for a specific structure you should use
    :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_p3m`. This function will also find the optimal
    ``cutoff`` for the  **neighborlist**.

    .. hint::

        For a training exercise it is recommended only run a tuning procedure with
        :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_p3m` for the largest system in your dataset.

    :param potential: A :py:class:`Potential` object that implements the evaluation
        of short and long-range potential terms. The ``smearing`` parameter
        of the potential determines the split between real and k-space regions.
        For a :py:class:`torchpme.lib.CoulombPotential` it corresponds
        to the smearing of the atom-centered Gaussian used to split the
        Coulomb potential into the short- and long-range parts. A reasonable value for
        most systems is to set it to ``1/5`` times the neighbor list cutoff.
    :param mesh_spacing: Value that determines the umber of Fourier-space grid points
        that will be used along each axis. If set to None, it will automatically be set
        to half of ``smearing``.
    :param interpolation_nodes: The number ``n`` of nodes used in the interpolation per
        coordinate axis. The total number of interpolation nodes in 3D will be ``n^3``.
        In general, for ``n`` nodes, the interpolation will be performed by piecewise
        polynomials of degree ``n - 1`` (e.g. ``n = 4`` for cubic interpolation).
        Only the values ``1, 2, 3, 4, 5`` are supported.
    :param full_neighbor_list: If set to :py:obj:`True`, a "full" neighbor list
        is expected as input. This means that each atom pair appears twice. If
        set to :py:obj:`False`, a "half" neighbor list is expected.
    :param prefactor: electrostatics prefactor; see :ref:`prefactors` for details and
        common values.

    For an **example** on the usage for any calculator refer to :ref:`userdoc-how-to`.
