                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Materialite *(Alpha Release)* 

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-alpha-red)

**Streamlined Microstructure Modeling for Materials Science and Mechanics**

## Overview

Materialite is a Python package that aims to integrate the fragmented landscape of microstructure modeling tools into a unified framework for materials science and mechanics research.

## Purpose

Researchers in computational materials science currently rely on a patchwork of disconnected tools—MATLAB scripts, Fortran codes, C++ solvers, and various Python libraries—that are often not user-friendly and don't communicate well with each other. Entirely written in Python, Materialite provides:

- **Unified data structure** that works across different modeling approaches
- **Streamlined workflows** from manufacturing processes to microstructure formation to mechanical properties
- **Simplified interfaces** for complex operations like tensor math and crystallography
- **Data exchange** with established tools (e.g. DREAM.3D, EVP-FFT)

## Current Models

- **Process Models**: Grain coarsening, laser heating temperature fields, microstructure evolution from laser melting
- **Mechanical Solvers**: Taylor model and small-strain FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) solver for crystal elasticity and plasticity
- **Constitutive Models**: Elasticity, rate-independent plasticity, elasto-viscoplasticity with multiple hardening laws

## Documentation

Documentation, demos, and examples are available at [https://nasa.github.io/materialite](https://nasa.github.io/materialite).

## Installation

> **⚠️ ALPHA RELEASE:** This package is under active development. APIs and interfaces are subject to breaking changes without notice. Not recommended for production use.

*Clone and cd into the repository*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasa/materialite.git
```

```bash
cd materialite
```

*Create and activate conda environment*
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

```bash
conda activate materialite
```

*Future releases will be available on conda-forge and PyPI.*


## Simple Example

Run a basic process-structure-property simulation using `Materialite`.

Import the core `Material` object, some models, and other required objects for model inputs.

```python
from materialite import Material, Order4SymmetricTensor
from materialite.models import GrainCoarseningModel
from materialite.models.small_strain_fft import SmallStrainFFT, Elastic, LoadSchedule
```

Create a default material (generates a 16 x 16 x 16 point grid).

```python
material = Material()
```

Create a model for grain coarsening (`GrainCoarseningModel` is a Potts Monte Carlo-based model).

```python
grain_coarsening_model = GrainCoarseningModel(num_flip_attempts=10**5)
```

Run the grain coarsening model, and assign random orientations to the grains in the `Material` that is returned by the model.

```python
material = grain_coarsening_model(material)
material = material.assign_random_orientations(region_label="grain")
```

Plot the grain ID values.

```python
material.plot("grain")
```

Create a model that will simulate uniaxial tension (`SmallStrainFFT` is an FFT-based full-field mechanical simulation).

```python
stiffness = Order4SymmetricTensor.from_cubic_constants(C11=250, C12=150, C44=120)
constant_strain_rate = LoadSchedule.from_constant_uniaxial_strain_rate(
    magnitude=0.001, direction="x"
)
mechanical_model = SmallStrainFFT(
    load_schedule=constant_strain_rate, constitutive_model=Elastic(stiffness=stiffness)
)
```

Run the model.

```python
material = mechanical_model(material)
```

Plot the stress field in the loading direction.

```python
material.plot("stress", component=0)
```
