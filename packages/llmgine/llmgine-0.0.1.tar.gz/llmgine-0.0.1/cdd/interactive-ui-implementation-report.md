## Differences from Original PR Specification

### Minor Architectural Adjustments

1. **Import Organization**: Reorganized imports in several files to follow the project's established patterns and improve maintainability.

2. **Bus Publish Method Signature**: The original PR assumed `bus.publish(event, wait_for_completion)` signature, but the actual implementation uses `bus.publish(event)`. Adjusted the load generation accordingly.

3. **Approval Command Integration**: The approval demo was simplified to focus on the core UI functionality since the approval system is already well-implemented in the bus architecture.

4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in WebSocket connections and API endpoints beyond the original specification for better production readiness.

### Additional Safety Measures

1. **Type Safety**: Added proper type hints throughout the implementation (though some type checker warnings remain for complex generic handlers).

2. **Logging**: Enhanced logging integration with the existing project's logging infrastructure.

3. **Resource Management**: Improved WebSocket connection management with proper cleanup and reconnection logic.

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- Kept all UI components in `src/llmgine/ui/` to maintain clear separation of concerns
- Created separate modules for state management, load generation, observability, and handlers
- Used dependency injection patterns consistent with the existing codebase

### 2. **State Management**
- Implemented a centralized `UIState` class to manage bus lifecycle, configuration, and UI components
- Used dataclasses for configuration management following project patterns
- Maintained thread-safe operations for WebSocket broadcasting

### 3. **Observability Integration**
- Leveraged the existing `ObservabilityManager` infrastructure
- Created `UIEventBufferHandler` that integrates seamlessly with the bus's observability system
- Implemented ring buffer for efficient event storage and streaming

### 4. **Load Generation**
- Built flexible load generation system using asyncio tasks
- Implemented configurable rate limiting and duration controls
- Added proper task lifecycle management with cancellation support

### 5. **WebSocket Communication**
- Used simple hub pattern for broadcasting to multiple connected clients
