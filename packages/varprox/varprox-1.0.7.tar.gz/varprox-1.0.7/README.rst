The Package varprox is designed for solving penalized separable non-linear least squares problems. It extends the standard variable projection method by adding regularization on the non-linear variable. More details can be found in the `documentation <https://varprox.github.io/varprox/>`_.

Package features
================

- Methods for minimizing separable non-linear least squares problems with penalizations and box constraints on variables.

- Non linear model fitting in engineering.

- Applications to the statistical inference for stochastic processes. 



Installation from sources
=========================

The package source can be downloaded from the `repository <https://github.com/Varprox/varprox>`_. 

The package can be installed through PYPI with
 
 pip install varprox
