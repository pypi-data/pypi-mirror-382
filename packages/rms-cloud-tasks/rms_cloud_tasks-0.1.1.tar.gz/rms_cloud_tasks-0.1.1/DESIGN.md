# Multi-Cloud Task Processing System Design Document

## System Overview

A scalable, multi-cloud task processing system that distributes independent tasks across compute instances, optimizing for cost and reliability with minimal overhead.

## Core Components

### 1. Task Queue Manager
- Uses native queue services (AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus)
- Handles visibility timeout/locking to prevent duplicate processing
- Automatically requeues failed tasks

### 2. Instance Orchestrator
- Monitors queue depth
- Provisions instances based on workload
- Terminates instances when no longer needed
- Selects optimal instance types based on cost

### 3. Worker Module
- Downloads processing code from GitHub on startup
- Polls for available tasks
- Processes task input (JSON)
- Handles graceful exit for spot instances

## Architectural Decisions

### Queue Management
- **Task Visibility**: Use queue-native visibility timeout mechanisms to "lock" tasks during processing
- **Completion Handling**: Workers delete/acknowledge tasks only after successful processing
- **Failure Handling**: Failed tasks automatically return to queue after visibility timeout

### Instance Management
- **Instance Selection**: System will analyze requirements (CPU, memory, disk) and select the lowest-cost instance type that meets requirements
- **Scaling Logic**: Scale up when queue depth exceeds threshold, scale down when queue depletes
- **Spot Instance Handling**: Implement handlers for spot termination notices to exit gracefully

### Worker Implementation
- **Initialization**: Pull worker code from GitHub on startup
- **Processing Loop**: Poll queue → Process → Mark complete → Repeat
- **Termination**: Worker self-terminates when queue is empty for a specified duration
- **Spot Instance Awareness**: Periodic checks for imminent termination

## Implementation Considerations

### Platform Abstraction
- Implement thin abstraction layer over cloud provider APIs
- Standardize instance provisioning/termination interfaces
- Standardize queue operations across providers

### Cost Optimization
- System will calculate and display estimated costs before execution
- Only use the specified maximum number of instances
- Terminate instances as soon as tasks complete

### Deployment Flow
1. User configures task inputs and execution parameters
2. System initializes queue with all task inputs
3. Orchestrator provisions initial instances
4. Workers process tasks until queue is empty
5. Instances self-terminate when no work remains

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring
- Implement basic job progress tracking (tasks queued/completed)
- Expose logs from worker instances
- Track instance lifecycle events

### Security
- Use user-provided credentials for all cloud operations
- Store credentials securely during execution

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handle cloud API failures
- Report batch-level errors to user

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Define cloud provider abstraction interfaces
2. Implement queue adapters for each platform
3. Develop instance selection algorithm
4. Create worker initialization and processing logic
5. Build orchestration controller
6. Implement basic monitoring and reporting
