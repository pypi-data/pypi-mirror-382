This module restores the v15 functionality in which you can configure
products for generating purchase tenders instead of draft purchase
orders.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The decision of who to buy from is decided by sales order, so it is not
useful to group by supplier in purchase orders.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to Purchases > Products > Products. #. Create a Storable product,
set the 'Buy' route and some vendor in the 'Purchase' tab. #. Set the
Procurement: 'Propose a call for tenders' option in the 'Reordering'
section of the 'Purchase' tab.

Usage
=====

#. Click on the 'Replenish' button of the previously created product. #.
The 'Buy' route and 'Vendor' field will be defined automatically. #.
Click on the 'Confirm' button. #. A new Blanket Order will be generated.
