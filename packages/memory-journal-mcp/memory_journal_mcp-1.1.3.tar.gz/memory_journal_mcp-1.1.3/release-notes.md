# Memory Journal MCP v1.1.3 - Production/Stable 🎉

## 🌟 Major Release Highlights

Memory Journal MCP has officially graduated from **Beta to Production/Stable**! This major release represents a complete evolution of the journaling experience, introducing powerful relationship mapping, visual knowledge graphs, enhanced workflow automation, and dramatic performance improvements.

After extensive testing and refinement, Memory Journal v1.1 is now production-ready and trusted for daily development workflows. This release transforms Memory Journal from a simple journaling tool into a comprehensive knowledge management system that understands how your work connects and evolves.

## ✨ New Features

### Entry Relationships
- **Link entries** with typed relationships (references, implements, clarifies, evolves_from, response_to)
- **Build knowledge graphs** of your work
- **Track how ideas evolve** over time
- New tool: `link_entries` for creating relationships
- Enhanced `get_entry_by_id` to show relationships

### Relationship Visualization
- **Generate Mermaid diagrams** showing entry connections
- **Multiple visualization modes**: entry-centric, tag-based, recent activity
- **Depth control** for graph traversal (1-3 hops)
- **Color-coded nodes**: Personal (blue) vs Project (orange)
- **Typed arrows**: Different styles for different relationship types
- New tool: `visualize_relationships`
- New resource: `memory://graph/recent`

### Performance Improvements
- **10x faster startup**: 14s → 2-3s through lazy loading
