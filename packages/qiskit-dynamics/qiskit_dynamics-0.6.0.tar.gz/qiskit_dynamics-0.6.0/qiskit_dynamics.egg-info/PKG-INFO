**This repo is no longer being actively maintained.**

Qiskit Dynamics is an open-source project for building, transforming, and solving time-dependent
quantum systems in Qiskit.

The goal of Qiskit Dynamics is to provide access to different numerical methods for solving
differential equations, and to automate common processes typically performed by hand, e.g. applying
frame transformations or rotating wave approximations to system and control Hamiltonians.

Qiskit Dynamics can be configured to use either [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) or
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) as the backend for array operations.
[NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is the default, and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is
an optional dependency. [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) provides just-in-time compilation,
automatic differentiation, and GPU execution, and therefore is well-suited to tasks involving
repeated evaluation of functions with different parameters; E.g. simulating a model of a quantum
system over a range of parameter values, or optimizing the parameters of control sequence.

Reference documentation may be found [here](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/), including
[tutorials](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/tutorials/index.html),
[user guide](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/userguide/index.html),
[API reference](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/apidocs/index.html), and
[Discussions](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/discussions/index.html).

## Installation

Qiskit Dynamics may be installed using pip via:

```
pip install qiskit-dynamics
```

Additionally, Qiskit Dynamics may be installed simultaneously with the CPU version of
JAX via:

```
pip install "qiskit-dynamics[jax]"
```

Installing JAX with GPU support must be done manually, for instructions refer to the
[JAX installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
