Overview
========

The mission of the Diffraction Limited Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (DL-NIRSP) is to measure solar
magnetic fields with simultaneous spatial and spectral coverage using diffraction-grating based integral
field spectroscopy in the visible and near-infrared spectrum.

The `dkist-processing-dlnirsp` code repository contains the implementation of the DL-NIRSP calibration
pipelines, which convert Level 0 files from the telescope into Level 1 output products. Pipelines are
built on `dkist-processing-common <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/common/>`_ tasks and use
the `dkist-processing-core <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/core/>`_ framework.
Follow links on this page for more information about calibration pipelines.

Level 1 data products are available at the `DKIST Data Portal <https://dkist.data.nso.edu/>`_ and can be
analyzed with `DKIST python user tools <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/python-tools/>`_. For help,
please contact the `DKIST Help Desk <https://nso.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals/>`_.
