====================

Misc
----

- Replace `FakeGQLClient` with the `fake_gql_client` fixture imported from the `mock_metadata_store` module
  in `dkist-processing-common`.  Because the fixture is imported into `conftest.py`, individual imports are not needed. (`#98 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/98>`__)


v0.29.0 (2025-07-10)
====================

Bugfixes

- Bump `dkist-quality`. This update contains machinery for plotting wavelength calibration results, which DLNIRSP doesn't use.... yet. (`#97 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/97>`__)


v0.27.0 (2025-06-26)
====================

Features
--------

- Increase permissiveness of valid IFU drift amounts. We now allow any groups *within the drift amount of the array edge*
  to change their size. Previously, we had only allowed groups right on the edge of the array to change. (`#91 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/91>`__)
- Allow demodulation matrices to *not* be fit spatially in the :py:meth:`InstrumentPolarizationCalibration <dkist_processing_dlnirsp.tasks.instrument_polarization.InstrumentPolarizationCalibration.fit_demodulation_matrices_by_group>`
  task. To turn off the fit set the "dlnirsp_polcal_demodulation_spatial_poly_fit_order" parameter to -1. (`#95 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/95>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Ensure that the IFU drift amount keeps the same number of spatial pixels in pairs of groups from the 2 polarimetric beams. (`#91 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/91>`__)

Bugfixes
--------

- Bad pixel map is now correctly saved as a binary (0 and 1) array. Previously it could have had values as high as 3. (`#92 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/92>`__)


v0.25.0 (2025-06-03)

  standard `DlnirspTaskBase` base. (`#71 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/71>`__)


Documentation
-------------

- Add exact, mathematical definitions for linearization algorithms. (`#71 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/71>`__)

v0.23.1 (2025-04-21)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Update the value of "BUNIT" key in L1 headers.
  L1 pixels do not have units because their values are relative to disk center at the time of solar gain observation. (`#79 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/79>`__)


Misc
----

- Remove our own version of `PolcalTaskFlower` and import the identical object from `dkist-processing-common` (even though we did it first :p). (`#78 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/78>`__)


Documentation
-------------

- Update online `L1 Science Calibration docs <https://docs.dkist.nso.edu/projects/dl-nirsp/en/latest/science_calibration.html>`_
  to include information about the units of L1 science frames. (`#79 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/79>`__)

v0.22.0 (2025-03-03)
====================

Features
--------

- Information about the initial set of values (e.g., the name of the GOS retarder) to use when fitting demodulation
  matrices now comes directly from the headers of the POLCAL task data instead of being a pipeline parameter.
  This allows different proposals to use different GOS optics without the need for parameter changes. (`#69 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/69>`__)


v0.21.6 (2025-02-26)

v0.21.5 (2025-02-24)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Make the `IFUDriftCalibration` task a workflow dependency for the `BadPixelCalibration` task.
  The bad pixel task needs the drifted group ID array to get the illuminated portion of the lamp gain frame. (`#63 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/63>`__)
- Use new `stddev_numpy_arrays` from `dkist-processing-math` to compute dynamic bad pixel mask from a large stack of dark frames.
  The old method of using `numpy.std` could easily cause an out-of-memory failure because it needed to load all arrays into memory at once. (`#65 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/65>`__)
- Make the amount CRPIX[12] values are rounded *only when sorting mosaic tiles* a pipeline parameter. (`#66 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/66>`__)

v0.21.0 (2025-02-06)
====================

Features
--------

- All mosaiced datasets will always have MAXIS = 2 in L1 headers, even if the mosaic only has one dimension.
  MAXIS[12] = 1 will be used to represent static axes. (`#57 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/57>`__)
- L1 mosaic index header keys are now correctly populated based on absolute orientation determined from WCS information (CPRIX).
  Previously they had been based on the DLNIRSP spatial step pattern keys, which were relative and could vary drastically depending on the spatial step pattern used. (`#57 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/57>`__)


Misc
----

- Bump some minimum dependencies for compatibility with new versions of `dkist-inventory` and `dkist-processing-common`. (`#57 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/57>`__)


v0.20.5 (2025-02-04)
====================

Features
--------

- Remove three read/write mixins for tasks: intermediate frame, linearized frame, and input frame.
  Replace the functionality of those mixins with a combination of the standard read and write methods
  from `dkist-processing-common` and new composite tags for intermediate frames and linearized frames. (`#59 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/59>`__)

- Bump dkist-fits-specifications to v4.7.0. This adjusted the TTBLTRCK allowed values, adjusted CRSP_051 and CRSP_052 to accommodate blocking filters,adjusted CRSP_073 to include a new grating, and added a new allowed value to CAM__044. (`#47 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/47>`__)


v0.14.1 (2024-10-01)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Make `IfuDriftCalibration` a workflow dependency of the `InstrumentPolarizationCalibration` task. (`#38 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/38>`__)


v0.14.0 (2024-10-01)
====================

Features
--------

- Account for the slow drift over time of the IFU in the FOV by measuring the offset between stored IFU metrology arrays,
  which are used during calibration, and the dataset currently being processed. (`#36 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/36>`__)


v0.13.0 (2024-10-01)
====================

Features
--------

- Add support for "dither" mode where each full mosaic is repeated a second time with a slight offset. (`#31 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/31>`__)


v0.12.1 (2024-09-27)
====================

v0.12.0 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.2.0. This includes upgrading to the latest version of Airflow (2.10.2).


v0.11.2 (2024-09-26)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.1.0. This enables the usage of the `NearFloatBud` and `TaskNearFloatBud` in parsing.


v0.11.1 (2024-09-24)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.0.1. This fixes a bug in the reported FRAMEVOL key in L1 headers. (`#37 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/37>`__)


v0.11.0 (2024-09-23)
====================

Features
--------

- Reorder task dependencies in workflows. Movie and L1 quality tasks are no longer dependent on the presence of OUTPUT
  frames and thus can be run in parallel with the `WriteL1` task. (`#34 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/34>`__)


Misc
----

- Use CALIBRATED instead of OUTPUT frames in post-science movie and quality tasks. This doesn't change their output at all
  (the arrays are the same), but it's necessary for `dkist-processing-common >= 10.0.0` that will break using OUTPUT frames. (`#34 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/34>`__)


v0.10.1 (2024-09-19)
====================

====================

Misc
----

- Accommodate changes to the GraphQL API associated with refactoring the quality database (`#33 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/33>`__)


v0.9.1 (2024-09-09)
===================

Misc
----

- Use High Memory worker for `InsturmentPolarizationCalibration` task.
  Writing the VIS demodulation matrices to disk is causing some memory issues on STAGE. (`#32 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/32>`__)


v0.9.0 (2024-09-09)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Perform Calibration Unit (CU) and demodulation matrix fits separately for each of the two polarized beams (instead of a
  single CU fit with the average of both beams). (`#30 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/30>`__)


v0.8.0 (2024-09-04)

Documentation
-------------

- Description of polcal bins in quality report no longer needs to include a dummy dimension. (`#27 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/27>`__)


v0.7.0 (2024-08-19)
===================

Features
--------

- Update linearity correction to average initial bias frames if more than one is found. Uses the last read NDR as opposed to the last NDR, which may be a bias NDR. (`#22 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/22>`__)


v0.6.4 (2024-08-15)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 4.6.0 of `dkist-fits-specifications` to correct allowed values of the TTBLTRCK header keyword.


v0.6.3 (2024-08-12)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 4.5.0 of `dkist-fits-specifications` which includes `PV1_nA` keys for non linear dispersion.


v0.6.2 (2024-08-05)
===================

Documentation
-------------

- Add pre-commit hook for documentation and edit README.rst. (`#18 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/18>`__)


v0.6.1 (2024-08-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Remove the loops from linear interpolation in remapping the ifu cube in order to speed up the code. (`#17 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/17>`__)


v0.6.0 (2024-07-30)
===================

Features
--------

- Update solar gain algorithm to compute a single characteristic spectrum across *all* slitbeams. This helps mitigate
  strong spectral gain feautres that exist across the entire spatial extent of a single slitbeam. (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/25>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Update "Avg Noise" QA metric computation to avoid errors caused by infinity values in the data. (`#16 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/16>`__)
- Calibrated L1 data no longer have large regions of all-NaN data at start and end of wavelength axis. This was fixed by
  constraining the reference "wavelength" axis to exclude regions with a large fraction of NaN values (the specific fraction is a parameter). (`#19 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/19>`__)
- Correctly parse the number of X/Y_tiles in cases where aborts lead to only a single complete mosaic/X_tile.
  This was very unlikely to happen in practice, but does come up in some of our tests. (`#20 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/20>`__)
- IFU cubes now have the correct spatial axis ordering. Previously the difference between numpy and cartesian ordering
  had caused the output spatial axes to be swapped. (`#21 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/21>`__)
- Preserve slitbeam scale differences in final solar gain image. This ensures that these real differences are corrected
  when the solar gain is applied to science data. (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/25>`__)


Misc
----

- Add DEBUG output to Science task that contains the stack slit spectra just prior to IFU remapping (called "SLIT_STACKED"). (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/25>`__)


v0.5.3 (2024-07-26)
===================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-common to v8.2.2 to fix some warning messages. (`#24 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/24>`__)

===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 4.4.2 of `dkist-fits-specifications` which includes the `PVi_j` keywords.


v0.5.1 (2024-07-15)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Use `TrialTeardown` task in trial workflow. This task sets the recipe run status to TRIALSUCCESS. (`#15 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/15>`__)


v0.5.0 (2024-07-15)
===================

Features
--------

- L1 output files are now fully remapped IFU cubes! (`#8 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/8>`__)
- Add trial workflow for processing data without activating downstream Data Center services. This is useful for
  making "official" L1 data for assessing the performance of the pipeline. (`#10 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/10>`__)
- Add the `TransferDlnirspTrialData` task. This task is used to collect a set of file produced during a pipeline run
  and move them to a permanent location outside of the local (and ephemeral) scratch. (`#10 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/10>`__)


Misc
----

- Build and upload the Manual Processing Worker (mpw) notebooks as part of the Bitbucket release pipeline. (`#11 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/11>`__)
- Local trial workflows that don't depend on OBSERVE frames (solar-gain-as-science and polcal-as-science) now produce
  the full set of L1 outputs (except the inventory ASDF). (`#12 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/12>`__)
- Bump `dkist-quality` to version 1.1.0. (`#14 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/14>`__)


v0.4.0 (2024-07-12)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Correctly mock/populate OBS_IP_START_TIME in local trial workflows that don't use Observe frames. (`#9 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/9>`__)


Misc
----

- Move to version 8.2.1 of `dkist-processing-common` which includes the publication of select private methods for documentation purposes. (`#13 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/13>`__)


v0.3.0 (2024-07-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 8.1.0 of `dkist-processing-common` which includes an upgrade to airflow 2.9.2. (`#7 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/7>`__)


v0.2.1 (2024-06-25)
===================

Misc
----

- Remove High Memory Worker requirement from `InstrumentPolarizationCalibration` task. (Should have been part of `PR #4 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/4>`__)
- Pin `twine` to non-breaking version in BitBucket pipeline

v0.2.0 (2024-06-25)
===================

Features
--------

- Greatly reduce memory requirements of `InstrumentPolarizationCalibration` task (and speed it up a little bit, too). (`#4 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/4>`__)


Misc
----

- Use `nd_left_matrix_multiply` from `dkist-processing-math` and remove the local Mixin that had this method. (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Don't initialize a `parameters` object `DlnirspLinearityTaskBase`; we don't use parameters in Linearization. (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Update for new usage of `_find_most_recent_past_value` now requiring `obs_ip_start_time` or explicit time.
- Use `asdf` codecs from `dkist-processing-common` instead of locally defined codecs (they were the same). (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Use `ParameterArmIdMixin` and `_load_param_value_from_fits` from `dkist-processing-common` (they're identical). (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Update all non-DKIST dependencies (and `dkist-processing-pac`) to current versions. (`#2 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/2>`__)
- Remove crufty "build_docs" and "upload_docs" from setup.cfg. (`#2 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/2>`__)
- Put `GroupIdMixin` on `DlnirspTaskBase` instead of using it separately for each Task class. This also helps
  soften the dependencies of the `CorrectionsMixin` on `GroupIdMixin` because now the presence of the `group_id_*` methods
  is guaranteed. (`#3 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/3>`__)
- Use pre-defined `*Tag.task_FOO()` tags and controlled `TaskName.foo` values, when available. (`#5 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/5>`__)


v0.1.1 (2024-06-12)
===================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-fits-specifications` to v4.3.0. We need this in DL-NIRSP so some dither-related keywords are no longer required.
  (They are only present if dithering is used). (`#6 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/6>`__)


v0.1.0 (2024-06-06)
===================

- Initial release. Mostly for first release to DC stacks (i.e., not "production" quality).
