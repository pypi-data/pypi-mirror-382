  function. The purpose of this function is to create a dialog in advance and allow the user setting it up before
  
  This function is part of the scripted contribution framework. It can be used in the scripts
  'dialog' functions to pop up user input dialogs, e.g. for creation commands. Passing of the
  contributions script context is mandatory for the function to work.
