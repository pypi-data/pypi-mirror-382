# @brief API for accessing the script based API extensions (services)
# 
# This API enables access to the script based API endpoint implementations, called 'services'.
# Each service is a script which is started in a server mode and adds various functions and
# endpoints to the ZEISS Inspect API.

    service process startup or running the global service initialization code (model loading, ...).
    - RUNNING: Service is running and ready to process API requests. If there are multiple service instances configured
    per service, the service counts as RUNNING not before all of these instances have been initialized !

    The `get_status ()` function can be used to poll the status until the service has been started.

    The function will return immediately, the service instances will be stopped asynchronously.
    The 'get_status ()' function can be used to poll the service status until all service instances
    have been stopped.
