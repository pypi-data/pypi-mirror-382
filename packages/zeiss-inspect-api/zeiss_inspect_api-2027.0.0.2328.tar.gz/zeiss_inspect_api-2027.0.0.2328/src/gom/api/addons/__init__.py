# @brief API for accessing the add-ons currently installed in the running software instance
# 
# This API enables access to the installed add-ons. Information about these add-ons can be
# queried, add-on files and resources can be read and if the calling instance is a member of
# one specific add-on, this specific add-on can be modified on-the-fly and during software
# update processes.

    uniquely address the add-on.

  def get_name(self) -> str:

    @brief Return the displayable name of the add-on

    This function returns the displayable name of the add-on. This is the human

    This function returns the installed ZIP file representing the add-on. The file might be
    empty if the add-on has never been 'completed'. If the add-on is currently in edit mode,
    instead the edit directory containing the unpacked add-on sources is returned. In any way,
    this function returns the location the application uses, too, to access add-on content.

    This function returns the 'configuration level' of the add-on. This can be
    * 'system' for pre installed add-on which are distributed together with the application
    * 'shared' for add-ons in the public or shared folder configured in the application's preferences or
    * 'user' for user level add-ons installed for the current user only.

    @brief Return if the add-on is currently edited
    @version 1
    
    Usually, an add-on is simply a ZIP file which is included into the applications file system. When
    an add-on is in edit mode, it will be temporarily unzipped and is then present on disk in a directory.

    The content of a protected add-on is encrypted. It can be listed, but not read. Protection
    includes both 'IP protection' (content cannot be read) and 'copy protection' (content cannot be
    copied, as far as possible)

    @brief Return if the necessary licenses to use this add-on are present
    @version 1
    
    This function returns if the necessary licenses to use the add-on are currently present.
    Add-ons can either be free and commercial. Commercial add-ons require the presence of a
    matching license via a license dongle or a license server.

  def get_tags(self) -> str:
    '''
    @brief Return the list of tags with which the add-on has been tagged
    @version 1
    
    This function returns the list of tags in the addons `metainfo.json` file.
    
    @return List of tags
    '''
    return self.__call_method__('get_tags')

  def get_file_list(self) -> list:
    '''
    @brief Return the list of files contained in the add-on
    @version 1
    
    This function returns the list of files and directories in an add-on. These path names can
    be used to read or write/modify add-on content.
    
    Please note that the list of files can only be obtained for add-ons which are currently not
    in edit mode ! An add-on in edit mode is unzipped and the `get_file ()` function will return
    the file system path to its directory in that case. That directory can then be browsed with
    the standard file tools instead.
    
    #### Example
    
    ```
    for addon in gom.api.addons.get_installed_addons():
      # Edited add-ons are file system based and must be accessed via file system functions
      if addon.is_edited():

    @brief Return the minimum version of the ZEISS INSPECT software required to use this add-on
    @version 1
    
    By default, an add-on is compatible with the ZEISS INSPECT software version it was created in and
    all following software version. This is the case because it can be assumed that this add-on is
    tested with that specific software version, not with any prior version, leading to a minimum requirement.
    On the other hand, the software version where an add-on then later will break because of incompatibilities
    cannot be foreseen at add-on creation time. Thus, it is also assumed that a maintainer cares for an
    add-on and updates it to the latest software version if necessary. There cannot be a "works until" entry
    in the add-on itself, because this would require to modify already released version as soon as this specific
    version which breaks the add-on becomes known.
