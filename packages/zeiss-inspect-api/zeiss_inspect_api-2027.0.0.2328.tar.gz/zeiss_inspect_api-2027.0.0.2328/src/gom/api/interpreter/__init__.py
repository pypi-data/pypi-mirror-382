# API declarations for gom.api.interpreter

# @brief API for accessing python script interpreter properties

# This API can access properties and states of the python script interpreters. It is used
# mainly for internal debugging and introspection scenarios.

  @brief Mark the start of a multi element creation block
  
  ```{warning}
  Do not use these internal functions directly ! Use the `with` statement format as described in the
  documentation below instead for an exception safe syntax.
  ```
  
  This internal function can be used to disable the signal generation which usually triggers a full ZEISS INSPECT
  synchronization after each element creation. This is useful when creating multiple elements in a row to avoid
  unnecessary overhead. The block has to be closed with the '__exit_multi_creation_block__' function, which is done
  automatically if the corresponding `with` statement syntax as explained in the example below is used. Please be aware
  that disabling full synchronization points can lead to side effects - use this feature with case and well considered
  !
  
  **Example**
  
  ```
  with gom.api.tools.MultiElementCreationScope ():
      for _ in range (1000):
          gom.script.sys.create_some_simple_point (...)
  
  # Synchronization signal is emitted here. Application is sync'ed and valid afterwards again.
  
  gom.script.sys.continue_with_some_other_stuff (...)
  ```
