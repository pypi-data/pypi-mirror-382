  @brief Returns the list of currently selected elements in the explorer
  
  This function returns the resolved list of single elements which are currently selected in the explorer. The
  selection mechanism as such is more complicated and selection of categories, groups, tags etc. is also possible.
  So the function is covering the very basic per element selection only.
