This is a maintained and extended fork of the [dbt-fabric](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabric) adapter. This fork has [additional features and bugfixes](https://dbt-fabric.debruyn.dev/feature-comparison/) compared to the original adapter.

The adapter was [originally developed by the community](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabric/graphs/contributors) and later adopted by Microsoft.
Given Microsoft's limited investments in the adapter, this fork aims to continue its development and maintenance.
