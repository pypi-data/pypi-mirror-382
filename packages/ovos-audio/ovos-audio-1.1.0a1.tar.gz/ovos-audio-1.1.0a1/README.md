# ovos-audio

The "mouth" of the OVOS assistant!

Handles TTS generation and sounds playback


_________

## Install

`pip install ovos-audio[extras]` to install this package and the default plugins.

Without `extras`, you will also need to manually install, and possibly configure TTS modules as described below.


_________

# Configuration

under mycroft.conf

```javascript
{

  // Text to Speech parameters
  "tts": {
    "module": "ovos-tts-plugin-server",
    "fallback_module": "ovos-tts-plugin-mimic",
    "ovos-tts-plugin-mimic": {
        "voice": "ap"
    }
  },

  // File locations of sounds to play for system events
  "sounds": {
    "start_listening": "snd/start_listening.wav",
    "end_listening": "snd/end_listening.wav",
    "acknowledge": "snd/acknowledge.mp3",
    "error": "snd/error.mp3"
  },

  // Mechanism used to play WAV audio files
  "play_wav_cmdline": "paplay %1 --stream-name=mycroft-voice",

  // Mechanism used to play MP3 audio files
  "play_mp3_cmdline": "mpg123 %1",

  // Mechanism used to play OGG audio files
  "play_ogg_cmdline": "ogg123 -q %1"
}
```

## ðŸ¤– Persona Support  

This project supports **dialog-transformer plugins** to customize the style or tone of the generated speech.  

By using [OpenAI Persona Plugin](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-solver-plugin-openai-persona), you can rewrite text dynamically based on specific personas, such as simplifying explanations or mimicking a specific tone.  

#### Example Usage:
- **Persona:** `"rewrite the text as if you were explaining it to a 5-year-old"`  
- **Input:** `"Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales."`  
- **Output:** `"Quantum mechanics is like a special kind of science that helps us understand really tiny things."`  

Examples of `persona` Values:
- `"rewrite the text as if it was an angry old man speaking"`  
- `"Add more 'dude'ness to it"`  
- `"Explain it like you're teaching a child"`  

To enable the OpenAI Persona Plugin, add the following to your `mycroft.conf`:  

```json
"dialog_transformers": {
    "ovos-dialog-transformer-openai-plugin": {
        "rewrite_prompt": "rewrite the text as if you were explaining it to a 5-year-old"
    }
}
```

## Using Legacy AudioService

The legacy audio service supports audio playback via the old mycroft api ([@mycroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/blob/dev/mycroft/skills/audioservice.py#L43) [@ovos](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-bus-client/blob/dev/ovos_bus_client/apis/ocp.py#L51))

by default OCP delegates to the legacy audio service when necessary and no action is needed, but if you want to disable ocp this api can be used as the sole media playback provider

> **NOTE:** once ovos-media is released OCP and this api will be disabled by default and deprecated!

```javascript
{
    "enable_old_audioservice": true,
    "disable_ocp": true,
    "Audio": {
        "default-backend": "vlc",
        "backends": {
          "simple": {
            "type": "ovos_audio_simple",
            "active": true
          },
          "vlc": {
            "type": "ovos_vlc",
            "active": true
          }
        }
    }
  },
}
```

legacy plugins:
- [vlc](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-vlc-plugin)
- [simple](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-audio-plugin-simple) (no https support)
- [mpv](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-audio-plugin-mpv) <- recommended default
- [chromecast](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media-plugin-chromecast)
- [spotify](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media-plugin-spotify)

**OCP technical details:**

- OCP was developed for mycroft-core under the legacy audio service system
- OCP is **always** the default audio plugin, unless you set `"disable_ocp": true` in config
- OCP uses the legacy api internally, to delegate playback when GUI is not available (or when configured to do so)
- does **NOT** bring support for old Mycroft CommonPlay skills, that is achieved by using the `"ocp_legacy"` pipeline with ovos-core
- [ovos-media](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media) will fully replace OCP in **ovos-audio 1.0.0**
