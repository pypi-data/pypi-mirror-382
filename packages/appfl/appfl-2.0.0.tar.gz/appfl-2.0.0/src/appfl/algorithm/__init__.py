"""
This module provides a base class to define the functions required to implement PPFL algorithms.
Please use:
    - `appfl.algorithm.aggregator` for server aggregation algorithms,
    - `appfl.algorithm.trainer` for client local training algorithms,
    - `appfl.algorithm.scheduler` for server scheduling algorithms
