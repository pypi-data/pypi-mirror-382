# Interactive Approval Workflow
#
# Demonstrates interactive blocks with pause/resume functionality:
# - Automatic checkpoint creation at pause points
# - Human-in-the-loop approval before critical operations
# - Conditional execution based on approval response
# - Resume workflow with LLM response
#
# This workflow simulates a deployment pipeline that requires
# explicit human approval before deploying to production.
#
# Workflow steps:
# 1. Run tests (automatic)
# 2. Pause and request approval if tests pass
# 3. Deploy only if approved
# 4. Send notification of outcome
#
# Usage:
#   # Execute workflow (will pause for approval)
#   result = execute_workflow("interactive-approval", {"project": "my-app"})
#
#   # Workflow pauses with:
#   # status: "paused"
#   # checkpoint_id: "pause_abc123..."
#   # prompt: "Confirm operation: Tests passed. Deploy to production? (yes/no)"
#
#   # Resume with approval
#   result = resume_workflow("pause_abc123...", "yes")
#
#   # Or deny deployment
#   result = resume_workflow("pause_abc123...", "no")

# How to use this workflow:
#
# 1. Execute the workflow:
#    execute_workflow("interactive-approval", {"project": "my-app"})
#
# 2. Workflow will pause at confirm_deploy block:
#    {
#      "status": "paused",
#      "checkpoint_id": "pause_abc123...",
#      "prompt": "Confirm operation: Tests passed. Deploy my-app to production? (yes/no)"
#    }
#
# 3. Resume with your decision:
#    resume_workflow("pause_abc123...", "yes")  # Approve deployment
#    OR
#    resume_workflow("pause_abc123...", "no")   # Deny deployment
#
# 4. Workflow continues:
#    - If approved: Deploys and sends success notification
#    - If denied: Sends cancellation notification
#    - If tests failed: Sends test failure notification
#
# Checkpoint behavior:
# - Checkpoint created automatically when block pauses
# - Workflow state saved (context, completed blocks, execution waves)
# - Can resume anytime with checkpoint_id
# - Paused checkpoints persist until explicitly deleted
# - Use list_checkpoints() to see all paused workflows
