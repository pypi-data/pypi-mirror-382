# Detective Snapshot 🕵️‍♂️🔍

Super simple Python decorator that automatically logs function inputs, outputs, and exceptions into a clean, searchable JSON file.

Just add `@snapshot()` to your functions and set DEBUG=true to capture every run. You can use json path expressions to select only the input variables you care about (including portions of self or cls), keeping your logs focused. For downstream functions, simply decorate them with @snapshot()—-no matter how deep they are in your call chain—-and all their calls will be captured.

This makes it ideal for debugging data transformations, pinpointing elusive bugs in deep, function chains, and comparing good versus bad runs with minimal setup.

## Features
- 📸 Capture function inputs, outputs
- 🎯 Select specific fields to snapshot
- 🌳 Track sequential function calls
- 📦 Support for Python objects, dataclasses, and protobufs
- 💥 Capture exception details

## Installation

```bash
pip install detective-snapshot
```

## Quick Start

Enable debug mode by setting either environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
# or
export DETECTIVE=true
```

With debug mode on, each call to an outermost decorated function creates a new snapshot file under `./_snapshots/` with a timestamp and unique hash.

Here's a simple example using a library catalog system:

```python
from detective import snapshot

@snapshot()
def get_book_details(book):
    author = get_author(book["author_id"])
    return f"{book['title']} by {author}"

@snapshot()
def get_author(author_id):
    # Simulate database lookup
    return "J.K. Rowling"

# Use the functions
book = {
    "title": "Harry Potter",
    "author_id": "jkr_001"
}
result = get_book_details(book)
```

This will create a debug file in `./_snapshots/` with content like:

```json
{
    "FUNCTION": "get_book_details",
    "INPUTS": {
        "book": {
            "title": "Harry Potter",
            "author_id": "jkr_001"
        }
    },
    "OUTPUT": "Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling",
    "CALLS": [
        {
            "FUNCTION": "get_author",
            "INPUTS": {
                "author_id": "jkr_001"
            },
            "OUTPUT": "J.K. Rowling"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Field Selection

Detective Snapshot supports both its own simple field selection syntax and full [JSONPath](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng) expressions out of the box. You can capture specific fields using various selection patterns:

```python
@snapshot(
    input_fields=["book.title", "book.author_id"],
    output_fields=["name"],
    include_implicit=False  # Default: don't include self/cls unless explicitly requested
)
def process_book(book):
    # Only specified fields will be captured
    pass
```

By default, `self` and `cls` are not included in the snapshot. You can include them in two ways:
- Set `include_implicit=True` to capture the entire self/cls object automatically
- Add specific paths like `"self.id"` or `"cls.name"` to `input_fields` to capture just those fields

### Supported Field Selection Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Direct Field | `name` | Select a field directly from root |
| Nested Field | `user.address.city` | Navigate through nested objects |
| Array Index | `books[0].title` | Select specific array element |
| Array Wildcard | `books[*].title` | Select field from all array elements |
| Multiple Fields | `user.(name,age)` | Select multiple fields from an object |
| Wildcard Object | `users.*.name` | Select field from all child objects |
| Args Syntax | `args[0].name` | Select from function arguments |
| Mixed Access | `users[*].addresses.*.city` | Combine array and object access |
| JSONPath | `$.users[?(@.age > 18)].name` | Use full JSONPath expressions |

## Advanced Usage

### Capture Complex Objects

```python
@dataclass
class Book:
    title: str
    author: str
    chapters: List[Chapter]

@snapshot(input_fields=["book.chapters[*].title"])
def get_chapter_titles(book: Book):
    return [chapter.title for chapter in book.chapters]
```

### Handle Function Call Chain

```python
@snapshot()
def process_library(library):
    books = get_books(library.id)
    return categorize_books(books)

@snapshot()
def get_books(library_id):
    return ["Book1", "Book2"]

@snapshot()
def categorize_books(books):
    return {"fiction": books}
```

The debug file will include the complete call hierarchy with inputs and outputs for each function.

### Exception Handling

If an exception occurs within a function decorated with `@snapshot`, Detective Snapshot will capture the exception details.  The output will include an `error` field containing the exception type and message.  Downstream function calls that *also* raise exceptions will have their exceptions captured within the `CALLS` section of the parent function.

```python
@snapshot()
def outer_function():
    try:
        inner_function()
    except ValueError:
        pass

@snapshot()
def inner_function():
    raise ValueError("This is an example error.")

outer_function()
```

This will produce a snapshot similar to:

```json
{
    "FUNCTION": "outer_function",
    "INPUTS": {},
    "OUTPUT": null,
    "CALLS": [
        {
            "FUNCTION": "inner_function",
            "INPUTS": {},
            "ERROR": {
                "type": "ValueError",
                "message": "This is an example error."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
If the outermost function raises the exception, the `OUTPUT` will contain the error.

### Class, Instance, and Static Methods

Detective Snapshot works seamlessly with class methods, instance methods, and static methods.

*   **Class Methods:** The `cls` parameter (the class itself) will be captured in the `INPUTS`. Only non-internal, non-callable, and non-decorator attributes of the class are included.
*   **Instance Methods:** The `self` parameter (the instance) will be captured.  If `self` has a `__dict__` attribute, it will be captured; otherwise, Detective Snapshot attempts to serialize it.
*   **Static Methods:** Static methods are treated like regular functions.

Here's an example demonstrating all three:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = "I'm a class variable!"

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.instance_variable = value

    @snapshot()
    def instance_method(self, x):
        return self.static_method(x + self.instance_variable)

    @classmethod
    @snapshot()
    def class_method(cls, y):
        return y * 2

    @staticmethod
    @snapshot()
    def static_method(z):
        return z * 3

instance = MyClass(10)
instance.instance_method(5)
MyClass.class_method(8)

```
The resulting snapshots will capture the relevant `self`, `cls`, and other parameters for each method type.
