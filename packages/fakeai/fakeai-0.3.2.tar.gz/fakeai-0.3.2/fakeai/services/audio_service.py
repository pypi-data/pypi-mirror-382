    Service for handling text-to-speech audio generation.

    This service simulates the OpenAI text-to-speech API, generating

    Supported voices:
        - alloy: Neutral and balanced
        - echo: Clear and expressive
        - fable: Warm and engaging
        - onyx: Deep and authoritative
        - nova: Bright and energetic
        - shimmer: Soft and gentle
        - marin: Natural and conversational (extended)
        - cedar: Rich and smooth (extended)

    Supported formats:
        - mp3: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (default, widely compatible)
        - opus: Opus codec (efficient streaming)
        - aac: Advanced Audio Coding (high quality)
        - flac: Free Lossless Audio Codec (highest quality)
        - wav: Waveform Audio (uncompressed)
        - pcm: Raw PCM audio (no container)

    Speed range: 0.25x (slow) to 4.0x (fast)

        Create text-to-speech audio.

        Generates simulated audio files in the requested format with realistic
        duration based on the input text length and speed parameter.

        Processing time is estimated based on:
        - Text length: Longer text takes more time to process
        - Speed parameter: Higher speeds require less processing time
        - Base latency: Simulates model initialization and encoding
