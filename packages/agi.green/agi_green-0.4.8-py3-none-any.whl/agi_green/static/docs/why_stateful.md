# Why Stateful?

In modern software architecture, stateless systems are often the default recommendation. They scale well, are easy to cache, and fit cloud-native paradigms. However, this bias doesn't always apply—especially for applications that don't require massive horizontal scaling and that benefit from persistent, real-time interaction between client and server.

This document outlines why a **stateful application model** is the right choice for our system, and when it's preferable to the conventional stateless alternative.

## Comparison: Stateless vs. Stateful

| Characteristic                          | Stateless (Conventional)                                 | Stateful (Our Approach)                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal Scalability**             | Easy to scale by adding servers                          | Requires sticky sessions or state replication               |
| **Caching & CDN Compatibility**        | Highly cacheable (e.g., HTTP GET)                        | Less cacheable; dynamic content via WebSocket               |
| **Resilience to Crashes**              | Recoverable; no in-memory state to lose                  | Needs recovery strategy (e.g., state checkpointing)         |
| **Latency & Responsiveness**           | Often involves repeated REST round-trips                 | Low-latency, real-time bi-directional communication         |
| **Complexity of UI State Handling**    | Clients re-send full context with every request          | UI context lives on the server, simplifying client logic    |
| **Backend Complexity**                 | REST services can become fragmented and redundant        | Stateful server logic is centralized and expressive         |
| **Suitability for Real-Time UX**       | Requires polling or long polling for updates             | Native support for push via WebSocket                       |

## Why Stateless is Often Preferred
- Works well in cloud-native environments with auto-scaling
- Easier to reason about in distributed microservice systems
- Aligns with RESTful and HTTP-based infrastructure (CDNs, API gateways)

## Why That Doesn't Apply Here
- Our system does **not require massive horizontal scaling**.
- We benefit from **persistent server-side context** that avoids the need for verbose client state resends.
- We already use **WebSockets** as the primary interaction model.
- Our users expect **low-latency, reactive behavior** that REST cannot provide without workarounds.
- Our platform, `agi.green`, is **designed for stateful, session-based logic**, enabling concise application code and seamless real-time UI updates.

## Conclusion
Stateful architecture is not inherently inferior—it's just less common in certain paradigms. For applications like ours that prioritize real-time feedback, simplicity, and tight UI-server integration, a stateful design isn't just viable—it's the better choice.
