Creating Directories with owner change
======================================

We can change the owner of the created directory if run as root:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = data-dir
    ... find-links = http://download.zope.org/distribution
    ...
    ... [data-dir]
    ... recipe = lovely.recipe:mkdir
    ... createpath = True
    ... path = ${buildout:directory}/with/subdir
    ... owner = nobody
    ... """)
    >>> import os
    >>> import pwd
    >>> nobody_uid = pwd.getpwnam('nobody')[2]
    >>> print system(buildout),
    Installing data-dir.
    data-dir: Creating parent directory /sample-buildout/with
    data-dir: Creating directory /sample-buildout/with/subdir
   
The owner of the subdir is changed:

    >>> path = os.path.join(sample_buildout, 'with/subdir')
    >>> os.stat(path).st_uid == nobody_uid
    True

But not the owner of the parent dir:

    >>> path = os.path.join(sample_buildout, 'with')
    >>> os.stat(path).st_uid == nobody_uid
    False
