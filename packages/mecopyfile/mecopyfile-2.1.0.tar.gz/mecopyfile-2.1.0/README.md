# PyFile

A modern Python library for intuitive file and directory manipulation with an object-oriented approach and advanced automation capabilities.

## Overview

PyFile provides a clean, object-oriented interface for file system operations in Python. Built on top of `pathlib`, it offers enhanced functionality for managing files and directories with support for recursive operations, content manipulation, structured data retrieval, and automated directory bootstrapping.

The library features a well-architected design with a base `Systorage` class that provides common functionality for both `File` and `Directory` objects, along with a custom `Path` wrapper for advanced path operations and cross-platform compatibility.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd pyfile

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic File Operations

```python
import pyfile

# Create a file object
file = pyfile.File("example.txt")

# Create the file if it doesn't exist
file.create()

# Write content
file.write("Hello, World!")

# Read content
content = file.read_to_end()
print(content)  # Output: Hello, World!

# Get file information
print(file.get_name())        # Output: example
print(file.get_extension())   # Output: .txt
print(file.get_path())        # Output: example.txt
```

### Directory Management with Auto-Loading

```python
import pyfile

# Auto-load directory contents on initialization
directory = pyfile.Directory("my_project", auto_load=True)

# Get all files recursively with segmentation
file_data = directory.get_files_paths(
    recursively=True, 
    segmentation=True
)
# Returns: [{"my_project": ["file1.txt", "file2.py"]}, ...]

# Get directory objects for further processing
subdirs = directory.get_directories(recursively=True)
for subdir in subdirs:
    print(f"Found subdirectory: {subdir.get_path()}")

# Process files with extension filtering
all_files = directory.get_files(recursively=True)
for file in all_files:
    if file.get_extension() == '.py':
        content = file.read_to_end()
        print(f"Python file: {file.get_name(with_extension=True)}")
```

### Automated Directory Bootstrap

```python
import pyfile

# Bootstrap multiple directory structures from a list of paths
project_paths = [
    "/path/to/project1",
    "/path/to/project2", 
    "/path/to/project3"
]

# Auto-load all directories and get their structures
all_directories = []
for path in project_paths:
    path_obj = pyfile.Path(path)
    directories = path_obj.get_directories(recursively=True)
    all_directories.extend(directories)

# Process all directories with auto-loading
for directory in all_directories:
    # Auto-load each directory's contents
    auto_dir = pyfile.Directory(directory.get_path(), auto_load=True)
    
    # Get all files in this directory structure
    files = auto_dir.get_files(recursively=True)
    print(f"Directory {auto_dir.get_path()} contains {len(files)} files")
```

### Advanced Path Operations

```python
import pyfile

# Working with paths for bulk operations
base_path = pyfile.Path("/workspace/projects")

# Get all directories recursively and auto-load them
all_dirs = base_path.get_directories(recursively=True)
auto_loaded_dirs = [pyfile.Directory(dir_path.get_path(), auto_load=True) for dir_path in all_dirs]

# Process each directory's contents with segmentation
for directory in auto_loaded_dirs:
    # Get files with segmentation for organized processing
    files_by_dir = directory.get_files(recursively=True, segmentation=True)
    
    # Process files in each directory
    for dir_files in files_by_dir:
        if isinstance(dir_files, dict):
            for dir_path, files in dir_files.items():
                print(f"Processing {len(files)} files in {dir_path}")
                
# Direct path-based file processing
all_files = base_path.get_files(recursively=True)
python_files = [f for f in all_files if f.get_extension() == '.py']
print(f"Found {len(python_files)} Python files")
```

### Batch File Operations

```python
import pyfile

# Process multiple files from different directories
source_dirs = ["/data/input1", "/data/input2", "/data/input3"]

# Auto-load all source directories
loaded_dirs = []
for dir_path in source_dirs:
    directory = pyfile.Directory(dir_path, auto_load=True)
    loaded_dirs.append(directory)

# Collect all files from all directories
all_files = []
for directory in loaded_dirs:
    files = directory.get_files(recursively=True)
    all_files.extend(files)

# Process files in batch with extension filtering
for file in all_files:
    if file.get_extension() == '.txt':
        content = file.read_to_end()
        # Process content...
        print(f"Processed: {file.get_path()}")
        
# Advanced: Process with segmentation for organized output
for directory in loaded_dirs:
    files_by_dir = directory.get_files(recursively=True, segmentation=True)
    for dir_data in files_by_dir:
        if isinstance(dir_data, dict):
            for dir_path, files in dir_data.items():
                print(f"Directory {dir_path}: {len(files)} files")
```

## Architecture

PyFile is built with a clean, object-oriented architecture that follows established design patterns:

### **Inheritance Hierarchy**
```
Systorage (Base Class)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ File (File operations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Directory (Directory operations)

Path (Utility Class)
Utils (Helper Functions)
```

### **Design Patterns**
- **Composition**: Systorage uses Path objects for path management
- **Template Method**: Directory.load() follows a consistent pattern
- **Strategy**: Flexible segmentation and recursive options
- **Factory**: Path class creates File and Directory objects

### **Key Features**
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with Python 3.7+ support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and exception handling
- **Performance**: Optimized with pathlib and efficient algorithms
- **Cross-platform**: Universal path format for Windows/Unix compatibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)
