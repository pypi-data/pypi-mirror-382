# PyCosmo

PyCosmo is a multi-purpose cosmology calculation tool in Python. It is
designed to be interactive and user friendly.

The code includes calculations of:
  - Background
  - Linear perturbations (incl. fitting functions and a Boltzmann solver)
  - Non-linear perturbations
  - Series of observables (e.g., weak lensing and galaxy clustering
    power spectrum, ...)
  - Several model extensions (massive neutrinos, wCDM, ...)


The code documentation can be found at

Interactive tutorial notebooks are available on the
[PyCosmoHUB](https://pycosmohub.com).
