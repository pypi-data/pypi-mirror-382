class Function:
    r"""Base class to create custom `autodiff.Function`.

    To create a custom `autodiff.Function`, subclass this class and implement
    the :meth:`forward` and :meth:`backward` static methods. Then, to use your custom
    op in the forward pass, call the class method ``apply``. Do not call
    :meth:`forward` directly.

    Example::

        >>> class Func(Function):
        >>>     @staticmethod
        >>>     def forward(ctx, x: hf.Variable):
        >>>         reverse = x.data[::-1]
        >>>         out = hf.Variable(data=reverse, role=x.role, requires_grad=True)
        >>>         ctx.save_for_backward(x, reverse, out)
        >>>         return out
        >>>
        >>>     @staticmethod
        >>>     def backward(ctx, grad_out):
        >>>         x, reverse, out = ctx.saved_variables
        >>>         grad = f"Here is the feedback for {x.role} (reversed): {grad_out.grad}"
        >>>         role = f"Feedback to {x.role}"
        >>>         x.grad = hf.Variable(data=grad, role=role)
        >>>         return x.grad
        >>>
        >>> a = hf.Variable(data="This is a string", role="Input string", requires_grad=True)
        >>> c = Func.apply(a)

        This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.
        There are two ways to define forward:

        Usage 1 (Combined forward and ctx)::

            @staticmethod
            def forward(ctx: Any, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
                pass

        - It must accept a context ctx as the first argument, followed by any
          number of arguments (variables or other types).

        Usage 2 (Separate forward and ctx)::

            @staticmethod
            def forward(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
                pass

            @staticmethod
            def setup_context(ctx: Any, inputs: Tuple[Any, ...], output: Any) -> None:
                pass

        - The forward no longer accepts a ctx argument.
        - Instead, you must also override the :meth:`afnio.autodiff.Function.setup_context`
          staticmethod to handle setting up the ``ctx`` object.
          ``output`` is the output of the forward, ``inputs`` are a Tuple of inputs
          to the forward.

        The context can be used to store arbitrary data that can be then
        retrieved during the backward pass. Variables should not be stored
        directly on `ctx`. Instead, variables should be saved either with
        :func:`ctx.save_for_backward` if they are intended to be used in
        ``backward``.

        This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.

        It must accept a context :attr:`ctx` as the first argument, followed by
        as many outputs as the :func:`forward` returned (None will be passed in
        for non variable outputs of the forward function),
        and it should return as many variables, as there were inputs to
        :func:`forward`. Each argument is the gradient w.r.t the given output,
        and each returned value should be the gradient w.r.t. the
        corresponding input. If an input is not a Variable or is a Variable not
        requiring grads, you can just pass None as a gradient for that input.

        The context can be used to retrieve variables saved during the forward
        pass. It also has an attribute :attr:`ctx.needs_input_grad` as a tuple
        of booleans representing whether each input needs gradient. E.g.,
        :func:`backward` will have ``ctx.needs_input_grad[0] = True`` if the
        first input to :func:`forward` needs gradient computed w.r.t. the
        output.
