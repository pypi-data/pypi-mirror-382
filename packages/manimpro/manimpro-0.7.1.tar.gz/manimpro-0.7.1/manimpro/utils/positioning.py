ManimPro Global Positioning Utilities
=====================================

This module provides global positioning functions that can be used anywhere
in ManimPro without needing scene context. These functions work seamlessly
with ValueTracker, always_redraw, and other ManimPro utilities.

Key Features:
- Global set_position() function callable anywhere
- Full compatibility with existing ManimPro pipeline
- Works with updaters, animations, and custom functions
- Maintains backward compatibility

Usage:
    from manimpro.utils.positioning import set_position
    
    # Use anywhere without self
    dot = Dot()
    set_position(dot, UP * 2)
    
    # Works in updaters
    def update_func():
        set_position(moving_dot, tracker.get_value() * RIGHT)
    
    # Works with always_redraw
    line = always_redraw(lambda: Line(ORIGIN, get_position(dot)))

    This is a global function that can be called anywhere without needing
    scene context. It provides a unified interface for positioning Mobjects
    and works seamlessly with ValueTracker, always_redraw, and other utilities.

        mobject: The Mobject to position
        position: Target position. Can be:
            - A 3D point/vector (e.g., [1, 2, 0], ORIGIN, UP, etc.)

            - Another Mobject to position relative to
        alignment: How to align the Mobject relative to the target position.
            Default is ORIGIN (center alignment). Use UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.

        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to underlying positioning methods
