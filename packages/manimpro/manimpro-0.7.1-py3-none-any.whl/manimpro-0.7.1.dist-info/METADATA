    <i>High-quality, portable, and user-friendly mathematical animation engine</i>
</p>
<hr />

ManimPro is a high-quality, portable, and user-friendly mathematical animation engine for explanatory math videos. It's used to create precise animations programmatically, as demonstrated in the videos of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> ManimPro is forked from the Manim Community Edition (ManimCE), which was originally forked from 3b1b/manim, a tool created and open-sourced by Grant Sanderson, creator of the 3Blue1Brown educational math videos. ManimPro focuses on enhanced portability, improved user experience, and professional-grade features for mathematical animation creation. If you would like to study how Grant makes his videos, head over to his repository ([3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)).

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> These instructions are for ManimPro _only_. Trying to use these instructions to install other versions of Manim or instructions from other versions to install ManimPro will cause problems. Read [this](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/faq/installation.html#why-are-there-different-versions-of-manim) and decide which version you wish to install, then only follow the instructions for your desired version.

ManimPro requires a few dependencies that must be installed prior to using it. If you
want to try it out first before installing it locally, you can do so
[in our online Jupyter environment](https://try.manimpro.org/).

For local installation, please visit the [Documentation](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/installation.html)
and follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

## Usage

ManimPro is an extremely versatile package. The following is an example `Scene` you can construct:

```python
from manimpro import *
from manimpro.utils.positioning import set_position


class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square()
        square.flip(RIGHT)
        square.rotate(-3 * TAU / 8)
        circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)

        # Use global positioning - works anywhere!
        set_position(square, ORIGIN)
        set_position(circle, ORIGIN)

        self.play(Create(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, circle))
        self.play(FadeOut(square))
```

In order to view the output of this scene, save the code in a file called `example.py`. Then, run the following in a terminal window:

```sh
manimpro -p -ql example.py SquareToCircle
```

You should see your native video player program pop up and play a simple scene in which a square is transformed into a circle. You may find some more simple examples within this
[GitHub repository](example_scenes). You can also visit the [official gallery](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/examples.html) for more advanced examples.

ManimPro also ships with a `%%manimpro` IPython magic which allows to use it conveniently in JupyterLab (as well as classic Jupyter) notebooks. See the
[corresponding documentation](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/reference/manimpro.utils.ipython_magic.ManimMagic.html) for some guidance and
[try it out online](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/manimpro/jupyter_examples/HEAD?filepath=basic_example_scenes.ipynb).

## Web Viewer

ManimPro includes a built-in web viewer for previewing your rendered animations directly in your browser:

```sh
manimpro preview
```

This launches a lightweight web server that automatically discovers and displays all your rendered videos with a clean, responsive interface. Perfect for reviewing your work and sharing animations with others!

## üéØ Global Positioning System

ManimPro features a powerful global positioning system that allows you to position objects anywhere without needing scene context:

```python
from manimpro import *
from manimpro.utils.positioning import set_position, get_position

# Works anywhere - no self needed!
dot = Dot()
set_position(dot, UP * 2)           # Vector positioning
set_position(dot, "UL")             # String constants (Upper Left)
set_position(dot, [1, 2, 0])        # Coordinate arrays

# Perfect for updaters and always_redraw
def update_dot(mob):
    set_position(mob, tracker.get_value() * RIGHT)  # Global function!

line = always_redraw(
    lambda: Line(get_position(dot1), get_position(dot2))  # Global functions!
)
```

**Key Features:**
- **üåê Global Usage**: Call `set_position(obj, target)` anywhere without scene context
- **üîÑ Full Integration**: Works seamlessly with ValueTracker, always_redraw, and updaters  
- **üìç Multiple Methods**: Supports vectors, string constants, and relative positioning
- **üîô Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work unchanged

See the [Global Positioning Guide](GLOBAL_POSITIONING_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation and examples.

## Command line arguments

The general usage of ManimPro is as follows:

![manimpro-illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manimpro/manimpro/main/docs/source/_static/command.png)

The `-p` flag in the command above is for previewing, meaning the video file will automatically open when it is done rendering. The `-ql` flag is for a faster rendering at a lower quality.

Some other useful flags include:

- `-s` to skip to the end and just show the final frame.
- `-n <number>` to skip ahead to the `n`'th animation of a scene.
- `-f` show the file in the file browser.

For a thorough list of command line arguments, visit the [documentation](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/guides/configuration.html).

## Documentation

Documentation is in progress at [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.manimpro.org/).

## Docker

The community also maintains a docker image (`manimpro/manimpro`), which can be found [on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manimpro/manimpro).
Instructions on how to install and use it can be found in our [documentation](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/installation/docker.html).

## Help with ManimPro

If you need help installing or using ManimPro, feel free to reach out to our [Discord
Server](https://www.manimpro.org/discord/) or [Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/manimpro). If you would like to submit a bug report or feature request, please open an issue.

## Contributing

Contributions to ManimPro are always welcome. In particular, there is a dire need for tests and documentation. For contribution guidelines, please see the [documentation](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/stable/contributing.html).

However, please note that ManimPro is currently undergoing active development. In general,
contributions implementing new features are welcome but should be discussed first.
The contribution guide may become outdated quickly; we highly recommend joining our
[Discord server](https://www.manimpro.org/discord/) to discuss any potential
contributions and keep up to date with the latest developments.

Most developers on the project use `uv` for management. You'll want to have uv installed and available in your environment.
Learn more about `uv` at its [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and find out how to install manimpro with uv at the [manimpro dev-installation guide](https://docs.manimpro.org/en/latest/contributing/development.html) in the manimpro documentation.
