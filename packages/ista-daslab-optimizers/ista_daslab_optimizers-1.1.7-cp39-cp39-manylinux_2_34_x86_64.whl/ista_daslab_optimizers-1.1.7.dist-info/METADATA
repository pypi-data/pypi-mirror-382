           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Installation
To use the latest stable version of this repository, you can install via pip:

```shell
pip3 install ista-daslab-optimizers
```

and you can also visit the [PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/ista-daslab-optimizers/).

We also provide a script `install.sh` that creates a new environment, installs requirements
and then installs the project as a Python package following these steps:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:IST-DASLab/ISTA-DASLab-Optimizers.git
cd ISTA-DASLab-Optimizers
source install.sh
```

## How to use optimizers?

In this repository we provide a minimal working example for CIFAR-10 for optimizers `acdc`,
`dense_mfac`, `sparse_mfac` and `micro_adam`:
```shell
cd examples/cifar10
OPTIMIZER=micro_adam # or any other optimizer listed above
bash run_${OPTIMIZER}.sh
```

To integrate the optimizers into your own pipeline, you can use the following snippets:

### MicroAdam optimizer
```python
from ista_daslab_optimizers import MicroAdam

model = MyCustomModel()

optimizer = MicroAdam(
    model.parameters(), # or some custom parameter groups
    m=10, # sliding window size (number of gradients)
    lr=1e-5, # change accordingly
    quant_block_size=100_000, # 32 or 64 also works
    k_init=0.01, # float between 0 and 1 meaning percentage: 0.01 means 1%
    alpha=0, # 0 means sparse update and 0 < alpha < 1 means we integrate fraction alpha from EF to update and then delete it
)

# from now on, you can use the variable `optimizer` as any other PyTorch optimizer
```

# Versions summary:

---
- **1.1.7** @ October 8th, 2025:
  - added code for `Trion & DCT-AdamW`
- **1.1.6** @ February 19th, 2025:
  - do not update the parameters that have `None` gradient in method `update_model` from `tools.py`.
  This is useful when using M-FAC for models with more than one classification head in the Continual Learning framework.
- **1.1.5** @ February 19th, 2025:
  - adapted `DenseMFAC` for a model with multiple classification heads for Continual Learning where 
  we have one feature extractor block and a list of classification heads. The issue was related to
  the model size, which included the feature extractor backbone and all classification heads, but
  in practice only one classification head will be used for training and inference. This caused some
  size mismatch errors at runtime in the `DenseCoreMFAC` module because the gradient at runtime had
  fewer entries than the entire model. When using `DenseMFAC` for such settings, set `optimizer.model_size`
  to the correct size after calling the constructor and the `DenseCoreMFAC` object will be created
  automatically in the `step` function.
- **1.1.3** @ September 5th, 2024:
  - allow using `SparseCoreMFACwithEF` separately by importing it in `sparse_mfac.__init__.py`
- **1.1.2** @ August 1st, 2024:
  - ***[1.1.0]:*** added support to densify the final update: introduced parameter alpha that controls
  the fraction of error feedback (EF) to be integrated into the update to make it dense. Finally, the
  fraction alpha will be discarded from the EF at the expense of another call to `Qinv` and `Q` (and
  implicitly quantization statistics computation). 
  - ***[1.0.2]:*** added FSDP-compatible implementation by initializing the parameter states in the
  `update_step` method instead of MicroAdam constructor
- **1.0.1** @ June 27th, 2024:
  - removed version in dependencies to avoid conflicts with llm-foundry
- **1.0.0** @ June 20th, 2024:
  - changed minimum required Python version to 3.8+ and torch to 2.3.0+
- **0.0.1** @ June 13th, 2024:
  - added initial version of the package for Python 3.9+ and torch 2.3.1+
