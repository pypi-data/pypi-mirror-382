Make commonly used Masked subclasses importable for ASDF support.

Registered types associated with ASDF converters must be importable by
their fully qualified name. Masked classes are dynamically created and have
apparent names like ``astropy.utils.masked.core.MaskedQuantity`` although
they aren't actually attributes of this module. Customize module attribute
lookup so that certain commonly used Masked classes are importable.
