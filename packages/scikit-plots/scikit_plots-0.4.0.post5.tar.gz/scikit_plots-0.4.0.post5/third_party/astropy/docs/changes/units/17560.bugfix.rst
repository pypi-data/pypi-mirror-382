Previously the string representation of the ``solMass`` unit in the ``"cds"``
format depended on whether the unit was imported directly from ``units`` or
from ``units.cds``.
Although both representations were valid according to the CDS standard, the
inconsistency was nonetheless needlessly surprising.
The representation of ``units.cds.solMass`` has been changed to match the
representation of ``units.solMass``.
