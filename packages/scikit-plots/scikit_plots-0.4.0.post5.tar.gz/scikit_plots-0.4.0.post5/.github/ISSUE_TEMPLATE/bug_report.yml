        If possible, please provide a minimum self-contained example. If you
        have used generative AI as an aid see
        https://scikit-plots.github.io/dev/devel/contribute.html#restrictions-on-generative-ai-usage.

      # If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com.

      # In short, **we are going to copy-paste your code** to run it and we expect to get the same result as you.

      # We acknowledge that crafting a [minimal reproducible code example](https://scikit-plots.github.io/dev/devel/minimal_reproducer.html)
      # requires some effort on your side but it really helps the maintainers quickly reproduce the problem and analyze its cause without any ambiguity.
      # Ambiguous bug reports tend to be slower to fix because they will require more effort and back and forth discussion between the maintainers
      # and the reporter to pin-point the precise conditions necessary to reproduce the problem.
