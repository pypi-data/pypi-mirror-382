HATS Import
========================================================================================

HATS is a directory structure and metadata for spatially arranging large catalog survey data. 
This was originally motivated by a desire to perform spatial cross-matching between surveys 
at large scale, but is applicable to a range of spatial analysis and algorithms.

.. attention::

    If you already have catalog in HATS format
    and are just looking to ingest it or analyze it, you can look instead to ``LSDB``, 
    a python tool for scalable analysis of large catalogs (e.g. querying 
    and crossmatching ~10‚Åπ sources). It aims to address large-scale data processing 
    challenges, in particular those brought up by `LSST <https://www.lsst.org/about>`_.

The ``hats-import`` package provides purpose-built map-reduce pipelines for converting
large or custom catalogs into HATS format.
