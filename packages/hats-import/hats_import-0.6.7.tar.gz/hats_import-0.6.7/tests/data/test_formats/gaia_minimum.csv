# This is a fun little CSV that mimics the structure of a gaia CSV file:
#  - a lot of lines at the top that start with #
#     - (they're just comments about what all the fields are)
#  - but then there's a valid header row that has all the field names in it
#  - then comes all the data.
#
# This also serves as a minimum reproducible example of an edge case 
# observed when importing gaia data:
#
#    the `libname_gspphot` column is often empty. when it's not empty, it's
#    a string. if you're doing a small slice of an import and end up with 
#    a partition that only has one row, and the value is empty in that row
#    then we will encounter a mismatched schema error (even if you're
#    trying to set the `use_schema_file` argument! how rude!)
