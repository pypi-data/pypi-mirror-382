Fitting Poisson distributed data
================================

Data that originates in a `Poisson process <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process>`_
can be encountered in many areas of science where the data consists of
discrete countable events. Examples include the number of photons detected
in a given time interval, the number of particles detected in a given
area, or the number of stars in a given mass range.

In principle, fitting Poisson distributed data follows the same steps as fitting
continuously distributed data. However, there are a few pitfalls to keep in mind.

Do not subtract the background
------------------------------
While the sum of two Poisson distributions is also Poisson distributed, the difference
is not. Thus, we cannot simply subtract the background from the data and then fit the result.
Instead, the background should be modeled separately and included in the fit as an additional
component. This ensures that the Poisson nature of the data is preserved.



Pick an appropriate statistic
-----------------------------

While very few distributions in science are truly normally distributed, in practice
they are often close enough that a :math:`\chi^2` statistic can be used and plots can
display symmetric error bars. Neither is true for Poisson distributed data, in particular
when there are fewer than 25 counts or so in any bin.

Sherpa implements `sherpa.stats.Chi2Gehrels` which applies a
weighting scheme to allow a :math:`\chi^2`-like statistic to be used (details and
references are given in the documentation for that statistic).
In general, though, Poisson distributed data should be fit by minimizing the
likelihood. Three options are available in Sherpa:
`sherpa.stats.Cash` and `sherpa.stats.CStat` differ slightly in the equations used (details
in the documentation for each class) and `sherpa.stats.WStat` allows has a different approach
to the background.


Keep your models positive
-------------------------
Both `sherpa.stats.Cash` and `sherpa.stats.CStat` calculate the logarithm
of number of counts in each bin and the logarithm of the model prediction.
To prevent the code from crashing when the model prediction is zero or negative, Sherpa
replaces such values with a small positive number before taking the logarithm.
This way, there is a step in the statistic when one or more model bins are zero or below
and the optimizer will hopefully move back into the allowed parameter space. However, if
the optimizer starts in the wrong place, it might be stuck.

The `sherpa.stats.CStatNegativePenalty` statistic applies a penalty
when a model value is negative. The idea is that the optimizer will -
unlike the `sherpa.stats.CStat` case - be able to push the model
parameters back towards a positive model, and so avoid getting stuck.

.. note::

   The assumption is that the parameter space that leads to negative
   model values is not close to the best-fit location. Care must be
   taken if the error range for the parameters include this
   problematic area of the parameter space.


Examples
--------

.. testsetup::

   >>> import os
   >>> os.chdir(doc_dir + "fit")  # so the load commands below work

The examples use these imports:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:
    :nofigs:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sherpa.stats import CStat, CStatNegativePenalty
    >>> from sherpa.optmethods import LevMar, NelderMead
    >>> from sherpa.fit import Fit

Fitting a gaussian model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, we will look at the distributions of count rates from
young stars in the star forming region IRAS 20050+2720. The data is from
`GÃ¼nther et al. (2012) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....144..101G/abstract>`_.
For this example, we downloaded the data and binned it.
The numbers are hardcoded below for simplicity.
We ignore the fainter half of the objects because the sample is probably
incomplete in this range. The cumulative distribution of observed X-ray fluxes
is often modelled as a lognormal distribution, but here we want to try to model
the non-cumulative distribution using a Gaussian distribution.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:
    :nofigs:

    >>> from sherpa.data import Data1DInt
    >>> hist = np.array([45, 50, 43, 30, 27, 32,  5,  8,  0,  4,  1,  0])
    >>> edges = np.array([-6.5, -6.3, -6.1, -5.9, -5.7, -5.5, -5.3, -5.1, -4.9, -4.7, -4.5,
    ...    -4.3, -4.1])
    >>> xrayflux = Data1DInt('xrayflux', edges[:-1], edges[1:], hist)

The data is clearly in the Poisson regime. The histogram has "number of stars"
in each bin, where the X-axis is the logarithm of the count rate. There are
even bins with zero counts.
Thus, we pick `~sherpa.stats.CStat` as the statistic and use the default
`~sherpa.optmethods.LevMar` optimizer which usually works well for count data.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:

    >>> from sherpa.models.basic import Gauss1D
    >>> xraydistribution = Gauss1D('xraydistribution')
    >>> xfit = Fit(data=xrayflux, model=xraydistribution, stat=CStat(), method=LevMar())
    >>> xfit.guess()
    >>> print(xfit.fit())
    datasets       = None
    itermethodname = none
    methodname     = levmar
    statname       = cstat
    succeeded      = True
    parnames       = ('xraydistribution.fwhm', 'xraydistribution.pos', 'xraydistribution.ampl')
    parvals        = (1.502103404881948, -6.254572554858249, 235.94188464394244)

    >>> mplot.overplot()

Dealing with negative models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This sample dataset contains a continuum with line emission, modelled
as a delta function. The signal is such that it is easy to end up with
the amplitude of either the continuum or line going negative, which
causes problems with :py:class:`~sherpa.stats.CStat`.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    >>> from sherpa.astro.io import read_pha, read_rmf
    >>> from sherpa.astro.plot import DataPHAPlot
    >>> pha = read_pha("P0112880201R2S005SRSPEC1003.FTZ")
    >>> rmf = read_rmf("P0112880201R2S005RSPMAT1003.FTZ")
    >>> pha.set_rmf(rmf)
    >>> pha.set_analysis("wave")
    >>> pha.notice(11.4, 11.7)
    >>> pha.group_counts(1)
    >>> dplot = DataPHAPlot()
    >>> stat1 = CStat()
    >>> dplot.prepare(pha, stat=stat1)
    >>> dplot.plot(linestyle="-", yerrorbars=True)

As this is a PHA dataset, the source model needs to include the
instrument response, calculated here with
:py:meth:`~sherpa.astro.data.DataPHA.get_full_response`:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:
    :nofigs:

    >>> from sherpa.models.basic import Const1D, Delta1D
    >>> bkg = Const1D('bkg')
    >>> line = Delta1D('line')
    >>> line.pos.set(11.5467, frozen=True)
    >>> rsp = pha.get_full_response()
    >>> source = rsp(bkg + line)
    >>> method = NelderMead()

When fitting with :py:class:`~sherpa.stats.CStat`, the fit ends up
stuck with a negative amplitude for the line:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:
    :nofigs:

    >>> bkg.c0 = 7e-4
    >>> line.ampl = 5e-2
    >>> fit1 = Fit(pha, source, stat=stat1, method=method)
    >>> res1 = fit1.fit()
    >>> print(res1.format())
    Method                = neldermead
    Statistic             = cstat
    Initial fit statistic = 116234
    Final fit statistic   = 7976.99 at function evaluation 329
    Data points           = 23
    Degrees of freedom    = 21
    Probability [Q-value] = 0
    Reduced statistic     = 379.857
    Change in statistic   = 108257
       bkg.c0         0.0007
       line.ampl      -1.15

This has happened because the model has ended up predicting negative
values for this set of parameters:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    >>> from sherpa.astro.plot import ModelPHAHistogram
    >>> mplot = ModelPHAHistogram()
    >>> mplot.prepare(pha, source)
    >>> mplot.plot()

The :py:class:`~sherpa.stats.CStat` statistic replaces these negative
predicted values with a constant term, and so the optimisation gets
stuck. When using :py:class:`~sherpa.stats.CStatNegativePenalty` the
optimiser is able to move the fit back into parts of the parameter
space where the predicted model values are positive:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:
    :nofigs:

    >>> stat2 = CStatNegativePenalty()
    >>> bkg.c0 = 7e-4
    >>> line.ampl = 5e-2
    >>> fit2 = Fit(pha, source, stat=stat2, method=method)
    >>> res2 = fit2.fit()
    >>> print(res2.format())
    Method                = neldermead
    Statistic             = cstatnegativepenalty
    Initial fit statistic = 116234
    Final fit statistic   = 17.816 at function evaluation 445
    Data points           = 23
    Degrees of freedom    = 21
    Probability [Q-value] = 0.660615
    Reduced statistic     = 0.848382
    Change in statistic   = 116216
       bkg.c0         7.69918e-05
       line.ampl      2.83667e-05

The resulting fit is a close match to the data:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    >>> dplot = DataPHAPlot()
    >>> dplot.prepare(pha, stat=stat2)
    >>> mplot = ModelPHAHistogram()
    >>> mplot.prepare(pha, source)
    >>> dplot.plot(linestyle="-", yerrorbars=True)
    >>> mplot.overplot()
