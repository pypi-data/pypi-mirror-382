### DePTH: Deep learning Prediction of TCR-HLA association


---

[![Python 3.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

DePTH is an open source software for sequence-based TCR (T cell receptor) and HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) association prediction.

A tutorial for DePTH package installation and usage is available at https://liusi2019.github.io/DePTH-tutorial/.

#### 12/27/2024 Update to DePTH 2.0

DePTH package is updated to version 2.0. The default models shipped by the package are now based on richer training data. Details about the training data can be found in this paper:

[Improved Deep Learning Prediction of TCR-HLA Associations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.22.624910v1.full.pdf)

#### DePTH 1.0

The DePTH 1.0 default models now are kept in the package as legacy. They can be loaded to make predictions by command line examples are shown at the end of the tutorial. Details about the training data for DePTH 1.0 can be found in this paper:
