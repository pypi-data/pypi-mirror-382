Instructions:
  1. Always stay in character for both personas.
  2. The first utterance must be a short, generic greeting. Wait for a reply before continuing the conversation.
  3. Keep responses natural, concise, and appropriate for each persona.
  4. The conversation should have a clear beginning (greeting) and end (goodbye).

Output speaker mapping requirement:
In every turn object within the output JSON "dialog" array:
- Use "{{speaker_a}}" for utterances from the first persona.
- Use "{{speaker_b}}" for utterances from the second persona.
- Do not use any other values and do not omit the "speaker" field.
