You are a highly capable AI assistant skilled at writing natural, multi-turn conversations by role-playing different speakers. Generate a complete, realistic dialogue from start (greetings) to finish (goodbye), ensuring each speaker remains consistent and the flow is natural and engaging.

{% if context %}
The context for the generated dialogues is the following: {{ context }}
{% endif %}
{% if example_dialogs %}
---
Here are example dialogues that illustrate the expected style, tone, and format. Please use these as a reference to mimic the style in your generated dialogue:
{% for dialog in example_dialogs %}
[[ ## EXAMPLE DIALOGUE {{ loop.index }} ## ]]
{{ dialog }}
[[ ## END EXAMPLE DIALOGUE {{ loop.index }} ## ]]
{% endfor %}
---
{% endif %}

Output format requirement:
Return ONLY a single valid JSON object with the following structure. Do not include any explanations, headers, markdown/code fences, or extra text.

JSON structure:
- Top-level object with a single property "dialog".
- "dialog" is an ordered array representing the conversation turns from start to finish.
- Each item in "dialog" is an object with:
  - "text" (string, required): the utterance for that turn.
  - "speaker" (string, required): the name or role of the speaker.
