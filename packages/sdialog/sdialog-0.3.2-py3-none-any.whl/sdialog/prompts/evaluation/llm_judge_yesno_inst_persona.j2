{% set is_plural = dialogs|length > 1 %}
You are an expert judge. Your task is to determine whether the speaker "{{ speaker }}" in the following {{ "dialogues" if is_plural else "dialogue" }} matches a specific persona, based on the provided set of attributes.

Carefully read the persona attributes below and then analyze the {{ "dialogues" if is_plural else "dialogue" }}. Consider whether the style, tone, behavior, and content of "{{ speaker }}" in each {{ "dialogue" if is_plural else "dialogue" }} match the described persona. Pay attention to:
- Consistency in "{{ speaker }}"'s speech patterns, vocabulary, and tone
- Alignment of "{{ speaker }}"'s actions, opinions, and emotional responses with the persona's traits
- Whether "{{ speaker }}" avoids contradictions with the persona's core attributes
- Subtle cues in "{{ speaker }}"'s language or behavior that support or contradict the persona

If "{{ speaker }}" in the {{ "dialogue clearly reflects" if not is_plural else "each dialogue clearly reflects" }} the persona, reply {{ "'true'" if not is_plural else "'true' for that dialogue" }}. If {{ "not" if not is_plural else "a dialogue does not" }}, reply {{ "'false'" if not is_plural else "'false' for that dialogue" }}.

Persona attributes are provided in JSON format:
[[ ## BEGIN PERSONA ## ]]
{{ persona }}
[[ ## END PERSONA ## ]]
