# Let's assume, that you have many git repositories
# gima allows you easier to manage commits, push and pulls of git repositories (but remember, gima is not a replacement for any other git client)

# Now, let's scan for git repositories, and let's add them to gima

gima --scan

# Now, let's make commits and push the changes

gima -c

# That's it!
