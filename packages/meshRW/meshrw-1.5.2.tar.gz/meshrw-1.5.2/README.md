`meshRW` is a Python module that proposes basic readers and writers for `msh` ([gmsh](http://gmsh.info)) and `vtk/vtu/pvd` ([Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)). It proposes:

* to read basic legacy `gmsh` mesh files (version: 2.2)
* to write mesh files including time series fields to any version of `gmsh` mesh files and legacy (`.vtk`) and XML (`.vtu`, with `.pvd`) VTK mesh file compatible with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).


## Installation

Installation via `pip install meshRW`

## Usage

### Examples of usage

Examples of usage could be found in tests files: [`test_msh.py`](meshRW/tests/test_msh.py) and [`test_vtk.py`](meshRW/tests/test_vtk.py). 

### Read mesh files

`meshRW` can read `msh` files only. Notice that no field can be read.

* For `msh` format ([only Legacy version 2](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#MSH-file-format-version-2-_0028Legacy_0029)):

    * Read the file

            from meshRW import msh
            dataMesh = msh.mshReader(filename=<name of the file>, dim=<2 or 3>)

        Argument `dim` (which is optional) could be switched to the value `2` in order to force to extract nodes coordinates in 2D (z-axis coordinate will be removed).

    * Get coordinates of the nodes
     
             nodes = dataMesh.getNodes()

    * Get the list of tags number 

             tags = dataMesh.getTags() 

    * Get the list of types of elements
     
             tags = dataMesh.getTypes() 

    * Get the list of elements
 
             elements = dataMesh.getElements(type=<types of elements>, tag=<tags>, dictFormat=<True or False>)
        
        The `getElements` property 


### Write mesh files

`meshRW` can write `msh` and `vtk` files. Basic static and **time dependent** nodal and elemental fields can be written aswell.

The common syntax for writers is the following

        from meshRW import XXXX

            XXXX.zzzzWriter(
                filename = <name of the file>,
                nodes = <array of nodes coordinates>,
                title = <title of the file> (optional),
                elements = [
                    {
                        'connectivity': <name of the file>,
                        'type': <type (string) of elements (TRI3, TET4...)>,
                        'physgrp': <list/array of physical groups>,
                    },...
                ],
                fields = [
                    {
                        'data': <array of data>,
                        'type': <type of data ('nodal' or 'elemental')>,
                        'dim': <ndimension of data's array>,
                        'name': <name of the field>,
                    },            
                    {
                        'data': <array of data>,
                        'type': <name of the file>,
                        'dim': <dimension of data's array>,
                        'name': <name of the field>,
                        'nbsteps': <number of steps (transient field for instance)>,
                        'steps': <list of steps (time steps for instance)>
                        },...
                ],  
                opts = {...} (dictionary of specific options)
            )

* For `msh` format (based on [Legacy format, version 2.2](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#MSH-file-format-version-2-_0028Legacy_0029) only with class `msh` and all meshes format provided by `gmsh` using class `msh2`):

    * for classical legacy file (not use the gmsh's libAPI) could be accessed by choosing `XXXX = msh` and `zzzz=msh` (`msh.mshWriter(...)`)
    * for any kind of  legacy file (not use the gmsh's libAPI) could be accessed by choosing `XXXX = msh2` and `zzzz=msh` (`msh2.mshWriter(...)`)
  
**NB for `.msh` files:** 
* `filename` must contain `.msh` extension
* `opts` could be (for `msh2` only) `{'version': VV}` (`VV` could be equal to `2, 2.2, 4, 4.1` that corresponds to `gmsh` mesh files version - `MshFileVersion`) 
* in the case of time series data, all the fields are given by default in the output file (to obtain one field per file, pass option `append = True` to the writer).

* for `vtk` format ([only non-binary legacy](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/VTKFileFormats/))

    * for classical legacy file (not use the VTK library) could be accessed by choosing `XXXX = vtk` and `zzzz=vtk` (`vtk.vtkWriter(...)`)
    * for any kind of  legacy file (not use the gmsh's libAPI) could be accessed by choosing `XXXX = vtk2` and `zzzz=vtk` (`vtk2.vtkWriter(...)`)
  
**NB for `.vtk|.vtu|.pvd` files:** 
* `filename` must contain `.vtk`, `.vtu` (recommanded) extension
* `opts` could be (for `vtk2` only) `{'binary': True/False, 'ascii': True/False}` (these options force data format in `.vtu` files) 
* in the case of time series fields, the fields are written separated series files with the following format : `basename.NNN.vtu` (NNN correspond the number of the step starting at 0). In this case, a [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#PVD_File_Format) `.pvd` file is also generated to declare all the steps and associated mesh files with the time step values.

            

<!-- ## Examples
### Example: load and display a mesh file from msh

### Example: add a static nodal field to an existing mesh

### Example: add a time-dependent nodal field to an exisiting mesh -->
