# HHI GDSFactory PDK 6.21.3

This PDK harnesses the full power of **GDSFactory+**, providing advanced tools for photonic design, including:

- **Simulations**: Seamlessly integrate and run photonic simulations.
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Ensure your designs meet fabrication requirements.
- **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)**: Verify that your layouts match the intended schematics.

## **Prerequisites**
This PDK requires an active **GDSFactory+** subscription.
For subscription details, please visit [**gdsfactory.com**](https://gdsfactory.com/).


## Getting Started

- Begin by reviewing the [GDSFactory+ Getting Started Guide](https://gdsfactory.com/plus/) and watching the tutorial videos.
- Open the **HHI sample project** in **GDSFactory+** to explore a working example and start building your own designs.
