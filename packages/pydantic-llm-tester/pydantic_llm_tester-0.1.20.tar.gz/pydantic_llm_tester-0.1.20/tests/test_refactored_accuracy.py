Tests for the *refactored* LLMTester accuracy calculation logic.

These tests define the expected behavior of the improved accuracy metrics,
including granular string matching, list comparison options, numerical tolerance,
and field weighting. They will likely fail until the _calculate_accuracy
method (or its replacement) is refactored.
