class SampleBasedMapping(GaussianMapping):
    r"""An approximate linear coupling between the reference and target densities.

    Builds an approximate linear coupling between the unit Gaussian 
    density and the joint density of the parameters and observations, 
    using a set of samples. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples:
        An $n \times d$ matrix containing a set of samples from the 
        target density.
    reference:
        The reference density. This must be a Gaussian density.
    perturb_eigvals:
        If this is set to True, the diagonal of the sample covariance 
        matrix will be multiplied by a number slightly greater than 1. 
        This will ensure it is positive definite.
    inflation:
        TODO: write this.
