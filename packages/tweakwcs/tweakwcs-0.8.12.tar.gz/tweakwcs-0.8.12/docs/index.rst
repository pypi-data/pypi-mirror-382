Welcome to tweakwcs documentation!
==================================

``tweakwcs`` is a package that provides core algorithms for computing and
applying corrections to ``WCS`` objects such as to minimize mismatch between
image and reference catalogs. Currently only aligning images with ``FITS WCS``
and ``JWST GWCS`` are supported.
