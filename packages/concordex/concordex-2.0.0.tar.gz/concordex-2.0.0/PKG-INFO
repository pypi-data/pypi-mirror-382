# concordex 2.0.0

The goal of `concordex` is to identify spatial homogeneous regions (SHRs) as defined in the recent manuscript, [“Identification of spatial homogenous regions in tissues with concordex”](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.28.546949). Briefly, SHRs are are domains that are homogeneous with respect to cell type composition. `concordex` relies on the the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph to representing similarities between cells and uses common clustering algorithms to identify SHRs.

## Installation

`concordex` can be installed via pip
```bash 
pip install concordex
```
.... and from Github 
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pachterlab/concordex.git
```

## Usage

After installing, `concordex` can be run as follows: 
```
import scanpy as sc 
from concordex.tools import calculate_concordex

ad = sc.datasets.pbmc68k_reduced()

# Compute concordex with discrete labels
calculate_concordex(ad, 'louvain', n_neighbors=10)

# Neighborhood consolidation information is stored in `adata.obsm`
ad.obsm['X_nbc'][:3]

# The column names are stored in `adata.uns`
ad.uns['nbc_params']['nbc_colnames']
```
