1. Ensure you have `uv` installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running `uv install uv`.
2. install graph-sitter with the command `uv tool install graph-sitter`.
3. initialize the codegen project with the command `gs init`.
    - This will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
4. To run codemods ensure that the terminal has activated the virtual environment by running `source ./.codegen/.venv/bin/activate`.


That's it! You're all set up.
