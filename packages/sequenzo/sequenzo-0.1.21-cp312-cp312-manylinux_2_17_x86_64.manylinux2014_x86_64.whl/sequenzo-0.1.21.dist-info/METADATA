# Sequenzo: Fast, scalable, and intuitive social sequence analysis in Python

Sequenzo is a high-performance Python package designed for social sequence analysis. It is built to analyze **any sequence of categorical events**, from individual career paths and migration patterns to corporate growth and urban development. 
Whether you are working with **people, places, or policies**, Sequenzo helps uncover meaningful patterns efficiently. 

Sequenzo outperforms traditional R-based tools in social sequence analysis, delivering faster processing and superior efficiency, especially for large-scale datasets. **No big data? No problem. You don‚Äôt need big data to benefit as Sequenzo is designed to enhance sequence analysis at any scale, making complex methods accessible to everyone.**

> üöÄ **Explore the official documentation at [sequenzo.yuqi-liang.tech](https://sequenzo.yuqi-liang.tech/en/)**  
> with tutorials, practical examples, and API references to help you get started quickly.  
>  
> üìñ Available in **English and Chinese**, our docs are written to be approachable, practical, and easy to follow.

## Target Users

Sequenzo is designed for:

- Quantitative researchers in sociology, demography, political science, economics, management, etc.
- Data scientists, data analysts, and business analysts working on trajectory/time-series clustering
- Educators teaching courses involving social sequence data
- Users familiar with R packages such as `TraMineR` who want a Python-native alternative

## Why Choose Sequenzo?

üöÄ **High Performance**

Leverages Python‚Äôs computational power to achieve 8√ó faster processing than traditional R-based tools like TraMineR.

üéØ **Easy-to-Use API**

Designed with simplicity in mind: intuitive functions streamline complex sequence analysis without compromising flexibility.

üåç **Flexible for Any Scenario**

Perfect for research, policy, and business, enabling seamless analysis of categorical data and its evolution over time.

## Platform Compatibility

Sequenzo provides pre-built Python wheels for maximum compatibility ‚Äî no need to compile from source.

| Platform         | Architecture                  | Python Versions       | Status            |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **macOS**        | `universal2` (Intel + Apple Silicon) | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ‚úÖ Pre-built wheel |
| **Windows**      | `AMD64` (64-bit)              | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ‚úÖ Pre-built wheel |
| **Linux (glibc)**| `x86_64` (standard Linux)     | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ‚úÖ Pre-built wheel |
| **Linux (musl)** | `x86_64` (Alpine Linux)       | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | ‚úÖ Pre-built wheel |


What do these terms mean?
- **universal2 (macOS)**: One wheel supports both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (arm64) Macs.
- **manylinux2014 (glibc-based Linux)**: Compatible with most mainstream Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).
- **musllinux_1_2 (musl-based Linux)**: For lightweight Alpine Linux environments, common in Docker containers.
- **AMD64 (Windows)**: Standard 64-bit Windows system architecture.

All of these wheels are pre-built and available on PyPI ‚Äî so `pip install sequenzo` should work on supported platforms, without needing a compiler.

**Windows (win32)** and **Linux (i686)** are dropped due to:

- Extremely low usage in modern systems (post-2020)
- Memory limitations (‚â§ 4GB) unsuitable for scientific computing workloads
- Increasing incompatibility with packages such as `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pybind11`
- Frequent build failures and maintenance overhead in CI/CD pipelines


## Installation

If you haven't installed Python, please follow [Yuqi's tutorial about how to set up Python and your virtual environment](https://www.yuqi-liang.tech/blog/setup-python-virtual-environment/). 

Once Python is installed, we highly recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) as your IDE (Integrated Development Environment ‚Äî the place where you open your folder and files to work with Python), rather than Visual Studio. PyCharm has excellent built-in support for managing virtual environments, making your workflow much easier and more reliable.

In PyCharm, please make sure to select a virtual environment using Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 as these versions are fully supported by `sequenzo`.

Then, you can open the built-in terminal by clicking the Terminal icon 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9e3af0-4286-47ba-aa88-29c3288cb7cb" alt="terminal icon" width="30" style="display:inline; vertical-align:middle;"> 
in the left sidebar (usually near the bottom). It looks like a small command-line window icon.

Once it‚Äôs open, type the following to install `sequenzo`:

```
pip install sequenzo
```

If you have some issues with the installation, it might because you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your computer. In this case, you can try to use `pip3` instead of `pip` to install the package.

```
pip3 install sequenzo
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Having Installation or Import Issues?

**Error:** `ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import` or `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed`

**Cause:** NumPy version incompatibility. Sequenzo 0.1.21+ requires NumPy 2.x.

**Quick Fix** (copy-paste these commands):
```bash
# Check your NumPy version first
python -c "import numpy; print(f'NumPy: {numpy.__version__}')"

# If you see 1.x.x, upgrade to 2.x:
pip install --upgrade "numpy>=2.0.0"
pip uninstall sequenzo -y
pip install --no-cache-dir sequenzo
```

**Note:** NumPy 2.x is backward compatible with code written for NumPy 1.x, so upgrading is safe.

üìñ **Still having issues?** 
1. Run our diagnostic tool to identify the problem:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liang-Team/Sequenzo/main/diagnose.py
   python diagnose.py
   ```
2. See our detailed guides:
   - **[QUICK_FIX.md](QUICK_FIX.md)** - Simple step-by-step solutions
   - **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Comprehensive troubleshooting
   - **[docs/WHY_IMPORT_FAILS.md](docs/WHY_IMPORT_FAILS.md)** - Technical explanation

### Optional R Integration

Sequenzo now checks the system environment variables before running ward.D hierarchical clustering.

If R is missing, a relevant prompt will be displayed along with specific installation instructions. If `fastcluster` is missing, Sequenzo will automatically download `fastcluster`.

Before automatically downloading `fastcluster`, Sequenzo checks whether R is available; if R is not installed, sequenzo will not automatically download fastcluster.

Sequenzo supports advanced Ward clustering methods that require R integration. If you need to use the `ward_d` clustering method, install with R support:

```
pip install sequenzo[r]
```

This will install the optional `rpy2` dependency, which provides Python-R interoperability. Note that R must also be installed on your system for `rpy2` to work.

For more information about the latest stable release and required dependencies, please refer to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sequenzo/).
