## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-07

### Added

- **Release Infrastructure**: Added `tests/packaging/test_packaged_version.sh`
  script to validate version consistency between `pyproject.toml` and installed
  package before deployment
- **CI/CD Integration**: Updated `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to run
  packaging validation tests before PyPI publication
- **Developer Tooling**: Added `.claude/commands/release-prep.md` slash command
  for streamlined release management workflow
- **Test Coverage**: Added 26 new unit tests covering:
  - All exception class constructors and serialization (`to_dict()` method)
  - Data session error paths (validation methods, stats generation)
  - Version string format validation

### Changed

- **Version Handling**: Simplified `_version.py` by removing
  `PackageNotFoundError` fallback logic (package metadata always available in
  deployment environments)
- **Test Coverage**: Improved overall coverage from 88.61% to 89.05%
  - `_version.py`: 71.43% → 100%
  - `exceptions.py`: 83.67% → 100%
  - `data_session.py`: 81.25% → 100%

### Fixed

- **Version Validation**: Packaging test now validates three-part semver format
  (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with regex pattern matching

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-06

### Fixed

- **Version Reporting**: Fixed `_version.py` to correctly report package version
  (0.1.1) instead of fallback "0.0.0" - now uses
  `importlib.metadata.version("databeak")` instead of `__name__`
- **Server Info**: `get_server_info` and `health_check` MCP tools now correctly
  return actual package version

### Changed

- **Version Management**: Converted from dynamic versioning (via git tags) to
  static version in `pyproject.toml` for more reliable version control
- **Test Implementation**: Updated version tests to read from `pyproject.toml`
  using `tomllib` parser instead of `importlib.metadata` for more direct source
  of truth

### Added

- **Unit Tests**: Added `test_get_server_info_returns_actual_version` unit test
  to validate version reporting
- **Integration Tests**: Added 5 new integration tests in
  `test_system_server_integration.py` to verify version propagation through the
  full MCP client stack

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-06

### Fixed

- **Type Safety**: Resolved 10 mypy type checking errors including missing type
  parameters, circular imports, and unused type ignore comments
- **Test Suite**: Fixed 35 failing tests by correcting fixture names, adding
  dict-to-object conversion for FilterCondition, and handling None values in
  validators
- **Circular Import**: Moved `CellValue` type alias to `models/__init__.py` to
  eliminate circular dependency between `typed_dicts.py` and `data_models.py`
- **Filter Operations**: Added dict-to-FilterCondition conversion with `==` to
  `=` operator normalization for backward compatibility

### Changed

- **Type Annotations**: Added generic TypeVar `T` to `apply_violation_limits`
  for improved type safety
- **Pandera Integration**: Fixed pandera.errors import path in
  validation_server.py
- **MyPy Configuration**: Excluded `examples/` directory from type checking to
  prevent false positives
- **Type Aliases**: Migrated `FilterValue` to modern `type` statement syntax
  (PEP 695)
- **Pydantic Validators**: Simplified validation logic in
  pydantic_validators.py, removed duplicate type hints, and streamlined field
  validator implementations

### Removed

- **Dead Code**: Removed unused `session_service.py` and `statistics_service.py`
  modules with dependency injection abstractions (0% actual usage)
- **Unused Models**: Removed `DataSchema` and `DataQualityRule` Pydantic models
  (61 lines) that were only tested but never used in production code
- **Deprecated Enum**: Removed `OperationType` enum that was marked for cleanup
  and had no active usage
- **Misleading Documentation**: Removed `docs/docker-deployment.md` that
  referenced deleted Docker files
- **Example Code**: Removed `examples/dependency_injection_demo.py` that
  referenced deleted modules
- **Try-Except Wrappers**: Removed 58 unnecessary try-except wrapper blocks from
  MCP tool functions (TRY301 violations) - FastMCP handles exception
  transformation automatically
- **Transformation Service**: Removed unused transformation_service.py module
  (676 lines, zero production usage)
- **Dead TypedDicts**: Removed 22 unused TypedDict classes (343 lines, 88.7%
  reduction in typed_dicts.py)

## [0.0.4] - 2025-09-30

### Added

- **Relaxed JSON Schema Validation**: Custom jsonschema validator that accepts
  integers as strings or floats, handling LLM-generated parameters that don't
  strictly conform to integer types (PR #115)
- **Integration Testing Framework**: Comprehensive integration testing with
  pytest config, isolated environment, and coverage reporting (PR #110)
- **ReadTheDocs Configuration**: Official documentation site with MkDocs
  integration and automated deployment (PR #108)
- **Type Safety Enhancements**: MCP-specific type definitions including
  NonNegativeIntString and PositiveIntString with regex validation (PR #111)

### Changed

- **Header Type Architecture**: Refactored HeaderConfig to use Abstract Base
  Class with Pydantic discriminated union pattern for cleaner polymorphic
  behavior (PR #113)
- **FastMCP Dependency**: Updated to use released fastmcp version instead of
  development branch (PR #114)
- **Testing Configuration**: Enhanced pytest configuration with integration test
  markers, coverage settings, and proper test isolation
- **Project Structure**: Streamlined documentation and removed unmaintained
  agent files and Docker infrastructure (PR #116)

### Removed

- **Docker Support**: Removed Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml as Docker
  deployment is not officially supported
- **Agent Documentation**: Removed specialized agent documentation files that
  are no longer actively maintained

## [0.0.3] - 2025-01-24

### Fixed

- **Circular Import Resolution**: Resolved critical circular import between
  `session.py` and `session_service.py` using lazy imports and TYPE_CHECKING
  blocks
- **Import Architecture**: Converted all relative imports to absolute imports,
  eliminating 15 TID252 ruff violations
- **MyPy Configuration**: Added `mypy_path="src"` to enable type checking from
  project root and pre-commit compatibility
- **Documentation Consistency**: Updated all documentation to use standardized
  `uv run mypy src/databeak/` command syntax

### Changed

- **Agent Documentation**: Streamlined test-coverage-analyzer agent description
  to focus on prescriptive guidance rather than current state information
- **Quality Pipeline**: Pre-commit hooks now pass completely with proper MyPy
  integration

  prevention)

- **Logging Guidelines**: Clear documentation for Context vs standard logger
  usage

### Changed

  extraction
- **Parameter Naming**: Resolved variable shadowing (format → export_format)
- **Test Structure**: Improved pytest patterns with proper exception testing
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs to reflect current architecture and
  quality standards

### Fixed

- **Security**: Eliminated silent exception handling (try-except-pass patterns)
