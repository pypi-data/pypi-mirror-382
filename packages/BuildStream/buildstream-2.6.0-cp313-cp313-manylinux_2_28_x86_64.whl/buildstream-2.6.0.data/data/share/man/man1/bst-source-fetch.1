.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bst source fetch
[OPTIONS] [ELEMENTS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fetch sources required to build the pipeline
.PP
    Specifying no elements will result in fetching the default targets
    of the project. If no default targets are configured, all project
    elements will be fetched.

    When this command is executed from a workspace directory, the default
    is to fetch the workspace element.

    elements.
.PP
    Specify `--deps` to control which sources to fetch:
.PP
    
        none:  No dependencies, just the element itself
        run:   Runtime dependencies, including the element itself
        build: Build time dependencies, excluding the element itself
        all:   All dependencies
