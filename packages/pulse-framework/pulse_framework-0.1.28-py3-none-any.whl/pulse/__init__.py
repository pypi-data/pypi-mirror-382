# ##### NOTES ON IMPORT FORMAT
# ########################
#
# This file defines Pulse's public API. Imports need to be structured/formatted so as to to ensure
# that the broadest possible set of static analyzers understand Pulse's public API as intended.
# The below guidelines ensure this is the case.
#
# (1) All imports in this module intended to define exported symbols should be of the form `from
# pulse.foo import X as X`. This is because imported symbols are not by default considered public
# by static analyzers. The redundant alias form `import X as X` overwrites the private imported `X`
# with a public `X` bound to the same value. It is also possible to expose `X` as public by listing
# it inside `__all__`, but the redundant alias form is preferred here due to easier maintainability.

# (2) All imports should target the module in which a symbol is actually defined, rather than a
# container module where it is imported.
