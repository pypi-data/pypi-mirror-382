## 🧠 Core Innovations

This library integrates multiple state-of-the-art optimization techniques validated through extensive research and practical training, with 1-bit compression for optimizer states:

### **Memory-Efficient Optimization (SMMF-inspired)**
- **Paper**: [SMMF: Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08894)
- **Approach**: Uses rank-1 non-negative matrix factorization with reconstruction cycle (factor → reconstruct → update → factor)
- **Innovation**: 
  - First moment split into **1-bit sign + absolute value**
  - Final storage: **four factored vectors + one 1-bit sign state**
  - Preserves Adam-like update quality with drastically reduced memory

## Simplified_AdEMAMix Parameters
Simplified_AdEMAMix replaces standard momentum with an accumulator for better small-large batch performance.

| Parameter | Recommended Values | Description |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| `beta1` | 0.9 (large BS), 0.99-0.9999 (small BS) | Determines memory length of accumulator |
| `alpha` | 100-10 (small BS), 1-0 (large BS) | Gradient smoothing factor |

**Alpha Tuning Guide**:
| Batch Size | Recommended α | Rationale |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Small (≤32) | 100, 50, 20, 10 | Emphasizes recent gradients for quick adaptation |
| Medium (32-512) | 10, 5, 2, 1 | Balanced approach |
| Large (≥512) | 1, 0.5, 0 | Emphasizes historical gradients for stability |

⚠️ **Important**: Use **~100x smaller learning rate** with Simplified_AdEMAMix compared to AdamW (e.g., 1e-6 instead of 1e-4)

### 📊 Performance Validation
Small Batch Training (SDXL, BS=2, 1.8K steps)
![Training Comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eff0671-cc59-47fc-8b63-d5205456d649)

- **🟢 Prodigy_adv** (beta1=0.9, d0=1e-5): Final LR=2.9e-4
- **🔵 Prodigy_adv + Simplified_AdEMAMix** (beta1=0.99, α=100, d0=1e-7): Final LR=5.8e-6

**Results**:
- Simplified_AdEMAMix shows faster convergence and better final performance
- D-Adaptation automatically handles aggressive updates (50x smaller LR)
- Generated samples show significantly better quality with Simplified_AdEMAMix

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. Prodigy_Adv Sensitivity
- Highly sensitive to gradient modifications (Adopt normalization, low-rank factorization)
- May fail to increase learning rate in some LoRA scenarios
- **Fix**: Disable factorization or set beta1=0

### 2. Aggressive Learning Rates
- Can destabilize factored first moment
- **Recommendation**: Check Prodigy learning rate as reference for safe LR threshold
