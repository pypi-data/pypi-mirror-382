**Story**: AI blog writer gets feedback from SEO optimizer and iterates until approved
**Flow**: Idea â†’ Blog Writer â†” SEO Reviewer (loop until approved)
**Features**: Multi-turn conversation, feedback loops, DSPy engine integration
**Wow Factor**: Watch agents collaborate and improve content through multiple iterations

### `03_mcp_tools.py` - MCP Integration
**Purpose**: Demonstrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration
**Story**: Analyze websites using external MCP tools
**Flow**: URL â†’ Website Analyzer (using MCP tools) â†’ Analysis Report
**Features**: MCP server integration, external tool calling, real-world data fetching
**Wow Factor**: See agents leverage external services seamlessly

### `04_dashboard.py` - Real-Time Dashboard (NEW!)
**Purpose**: Showcase the live dashboard visualization
**Story**: Watch the blog review pipeline execute with real-time visual feedback
**Flow**: Same as `02_blog_review.py` but with live dashboard UI
**Features**:
- Real-time graph visualization (Agent View & Blackboard View)
- Live streaming LLM output
- Event log with filtering
- Publish/Invoke controls from browser
- Session persistence (positions saved)

**Wow Factor**: Open your browser and watch AI agents work in real-time!

## Running Showcase Examples

```bash
# From project root
cd /home/ara/work/flock-flow

# Basic pipeline (runs in terminal)
uv run examples/showcase/01_hello_flock.py

# Review loop (terminal output)
uv run examples/showcase/02_blog_review.py

# MCP integration (requires read-website-fast-mcp-server)
uv run examples/showcase/03_mcp_tools.py

# Real-time dashboard (opens browser automatically!)
uv run examples/showcase/04_dashboard.py
```

## Creating New Showcase Examples

**Checklist for showcase examples**:
- [ ] Tell a compelling story (not just technical demonstration)
- [ ] Minimize setup complexity (easy to run)
- [ ] Include progress indicators and visual feedback
- [ ] Create "wow moments" (surprising or delightful outputs)
- [ ] Add clear narrative comments explaining what's happening
- [ ] Keep execution time reasonable (< 2 minutes)
- [ ] Test on fresh environments

**Template**:
```python

import asyncio
from flock.orchestrator import Flock

# ... imports ...

# 1. Define artifacts with comments
@flock_type
class Input(BaseModel):

# 2. Create orchestrator

# 3. Define agents with narrative comments
# "First, we need an agent to..."
agent1 = orchestrator.agent("name").consumes(Input).publishes(Output)

# 4. Publish initial artifact with progress output
print("ðŸŽ¬ Starting the [story]...")
orchestrator.publish(Input(...))

# 5. Run with feedback
asyncio.run(orchestrator.serve(dashboard=True))  # Auto-opens dashboard!
