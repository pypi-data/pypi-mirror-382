description: "Bluesky is a library for experiment control and collection of scientific\
  \ data and metadata. It emphasizes the following virtues:\n\n    Live, Streaming\
  \ Data: Available for inline visualization and processing.\n\n    Rich Metadata:\
  \ Captured and organized to facilitate reproducibility and searchability.\n\n  \
  \  Experiment Generality: Seamlessly reuse a procedure on completely different hardware.\n\
  \n    Interruption Recovery: Experiments are “rewindable,” recovering cleanly from\
  \ interruptions.\n\n    Automated Suspend/Resume: Experiments can be run unattended,\
  \ automatically suspending and resuming if needed.\n\n    Pluggable I/O: Export\
  \ data (live) into any desired format or database.\n\n    Customizability: Integrate\
  \ custom experimental procedures and commands, and get the I/O and interruption\
  \ features for free.\n\n    Integration with Scientific Python: Interface naturally\
  \ with numpy and Python scientific stack."
