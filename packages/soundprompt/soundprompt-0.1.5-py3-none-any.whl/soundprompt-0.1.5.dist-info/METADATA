# SoundPrompt
## Your sounds, triggered by AI

SoundPrompt is a tool that plays your prerecorded audio files with AI prompts. It can enhance podcasts, live streams, online calls, and pranks / trolling by adding dynamic elements like music, sound effects, and custom audio cues to engage an audience or inject humor.

### Get Started

## Soundboard: a relic of the past!

Using mechanical or software controls to trigger sounds is an unintuitive process that requires practice and scales horribly. SoundPrompt solves these problems by utilizing the power of Artificial Intelligence and modern hardware to play the sounds you want, faster than you ever could.
