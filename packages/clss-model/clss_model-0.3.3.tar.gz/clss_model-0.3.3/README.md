## Abstract

> Amino acid sequence dictates the three-dimensional structure and biological function of proteins. Yet, despite decades of research, our understanding of the interplay between sequence and structure is incomplete. To meet this challenge, we introduce Contrastive Learning Sequence-Structure (CLSS), an AI-based contrastive learning model trained to co-embed sequence and structure information in a self-supervised manner. We trained CLSS on large and diverse sets of protein building blocks called domains. CLSS represents both sequences and structures as vectors in the same high-dimensional space, where distance relates to sequence-structure similarity. Thus, CLSS provides a natural way to represent the protein universe, reflecting evolutionary relationships, as well as structural changes. We find that CLSS refines expert knowledge about the global organization of protein space, and highlights transitional forms that resist hierarchical classification. CLSS reveals linkage between domains of seemingly separate lineages, thereby significantly improving our understanding of evolutionary design.

## TL;DR

**CLSS** is a self-supervised, two-tower contrastive model that co-embeds **protein sequences** and **structures** into a **shared 32‑D space**, enabling unified mapping of protein space across modalities.

---

## Key ideas

* **Two-tower architecture:** sequence tower (ESM2‑like, \~35M params) co-trained; structure tower (ESM3) kept frozen; both feed **32‑D L2‑normalized adapters**.
* **Segment-aware training:** contrastive pairs match **full-domain structures** with **random sequence sub-segments (≥10 aa)** to encode contextual compatibility.
* **Unified embeddings:** sequences, structures, and subsequences align in a **single space**; distances track ECOD hierarchy and reveal cross-fold relationships.
* **Scale & efficiency:** \~36M trainable params, compact embeddings (32‑D) supporting efficient inference and training.
* **Resources:** code + weights, and a public **CLSS viewer** for exploration.
