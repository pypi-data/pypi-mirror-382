"""Deterministic text-only writer utilities.

This module implements :class:`SafeTextFileWriter` and a convenience
``open_text_writer`` context manager. Writes always use the configured
encoding and normalize newline characters to a canonical form (LF) to
ensure consistent files across platforms.

Example:
    with open_text_writer("out.txt") as buf:
        buf.write("line1\nline2\n")
