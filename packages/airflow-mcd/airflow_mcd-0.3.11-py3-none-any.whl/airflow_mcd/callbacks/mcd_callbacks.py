"""
Monte Carlo callbacks module.

You can use the provided helper dictionaries to install MC callbacks, for example
for dags, you can use `dag_callbacks` to install MC callbacks:
::
    from airflow_mcd.callbacks import mcd_callbacks

    dag = DAG(
        'name',
        **mcd_callbacks.dag_callbacks,
    )


For tasks, you can use `task_callbacks` to install MC callbacks in all your tasks using `default_args`:
::
    dag = DAG(
        'name',
        default_args={
            **mcd_callbacks.task_callbacks,
        }
    )

You can also install callbacks on a per-task basis:
::
    task = BashOperator(
        task_id='print_date',
        bash_command='command',
        dag=dag,
        **mcd_callbacks.task_callbacks,
    )

If you have your own callbacks, you can call MC callbacks manually from your code:
::
    def dag_success_alert(context):
        #processing code

        #invoke MC event processing
        mcd_callbacks.mcd_dag_success_callback(context)

Configuring the connection to Monte Carlo: you need to create an HTTP connection in Airflow with name
`mcd_default_session` and the following attributes:

* login: your mcd_id value
* password: your mcd_token value
* or using extra attributes: {"mcd_id": "ID", "mcd_token": "Token"}

If you set the connection name to something that is not the default value ("mcd_default_session")
you need to specify the connection name as a DAG parameter with name `mcd_session_conn_id`, like:
::
    dag = DAG(
        'name',
        params={'mcd_connection_id': 'my_connection_id'}
        **mcd_callbacks.dag_callbacks,
    )
