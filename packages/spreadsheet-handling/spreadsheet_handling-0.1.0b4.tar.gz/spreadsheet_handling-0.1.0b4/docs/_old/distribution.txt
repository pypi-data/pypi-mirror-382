To distribute a Python project, especially for non-Python users, there are a few recommended options outlined in the book that you might find useful:

1. Creating a Package with setuptools: You can create a source distribution (sdist) or a binary distribution (like a wheel) using `setuptools`. This process involves creating a `setup.py` file with all the package metadata, and you can generate the packages using commands like:
   python3.10 setup.py sdist
   python3.10 setup.py bdist_wheel

                        Copy
                    

You can then upload these packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `twine`, which allows users to install your package using `pip`.

2. Using Docker: Another effective way to distribute applications is via Docker. By creating a Docker image that contains your application and all its dependencies, you can ensure that it runs consistently across various environments. This is particularly useful for non-technical colleagues as they would only need to run a Docker command to execute your application. You would prepare your application for Docker by creating a `Dockerfile`, which specifies the environment and dependencies required to run your Python program.
