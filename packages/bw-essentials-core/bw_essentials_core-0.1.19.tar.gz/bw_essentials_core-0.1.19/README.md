It simplifies operations such as **AWS S3 interactions**, **email notifications**, and **version-controlled data lake workflows using LakeFS**. Designed for flexibility and ease of integration, it's well-suited for use across microservices, data pipelines, and automation frameworks.

In addition to infrastructure utilities, it also includes service-specific wrappers for:

1. Master Data  
2. Market Pricer  
3. Broker  
4. Model Portfolio Reporting  
5. Trade Placement

## üß™ Example Use Case

```python
# Send notification with S3 report
from bw_essentials.s3_utils import S3Utils
from bw_essentials.email_client import EmailClient

s3 = S3Utils("AK", "SK")
file_path = "/tmp/report.csv"
s3.download_file("my-bucket", "reports/weekly.csv", file_path)

email_client = EmailClient("me@example.com", "Report Bot")
email_client.send_email_with_attachment(
    to_addresses="client@example.com",
    cc_addresses=["ops@example.com"],
    subject="Weekly Report",
    body="<h1>Attached is your report</h1>",
    attachment_path=file_path
)
```

## üîî Notifications

`Notifications` helps send structured alerts and logs to external communication tools like **Microsoft Teams** and **Zenduty**. Ideal for operational awareness and incident response workflows.

### üîß Initialization

```python
from bw_essentials.notifications import Notifications

notifier = Notifications(

```

### ‚úÖ Available Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
