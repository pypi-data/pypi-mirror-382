- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add type hints where possible

### Example

```python
def scan_file(self, file_path: Path, use_ast: bool = True) -> Set[str]:
    """
    Scan a single Python file for environment variables.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the Python file
        use_ast: Whether to use AST parsing
        
    Returns:
        Set of environment variable names found
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common test setups
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest

# Specific test file
pytest tests/test_scanner.py

# Specific test
pytest tests/test_scanner.py::TestEnvScanner::test_scan_directory

# With coverage
pytest --cov=env_scanner --cov-report=html

# Verbose output
pytest -v
```
