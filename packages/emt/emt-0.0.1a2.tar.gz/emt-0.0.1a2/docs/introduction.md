Our rapidly evolving digital landscape is characterized by the ceaseless creation, deployment, testing, and operation of software applications and digital workloads. This constant activity comes at an environmental cost: every step consumes substantial energy, leading to a growing carbon footprint and the accelerated depletion of resources. Sustainable computing practices are crucial for reducing the environmental impact of this cycle, especially as climate concerns rise and resources become increasingly limited. Energy monitoring tools are critical for understanding and optimizing energy usage within this digital world.

The Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT) is an open-source solution for granular, real-time energy consumption data. It enhances energy observability, enabling users to identify hotspots and optimize resource utilization for sustainability and cost efficiency. EMT supports per-process energy estimation and Prometheus-based telemetry and c with advanced virtualization support.
