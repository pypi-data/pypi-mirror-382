# Executive Summary

The Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT) is an open-source solution for granular, real-time energy consumption data. It enhances energy observability, enabling users to identify hotspots and optimize resource utilization for sustainability and cost efficiency. EMT supports detailed per-process energy estimation and Prometheus-based telemetry, with a focus on virtualization challenges in containers and VMs.

Unlike many tools such as Kepler or PowerAPI, EMT is designed from the ground up to address the unique challenges of energy attribution in virtualized environments, including both containers and VMs, and to provide seamless integration with standard observability stacks.
