# Conclusion and Recommendations

The Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT) is a critical open-source initiative for energy observability in modern computing. Its dual operation modes, focus on virtualization, and advanced data collection make it a valuable tool for sustainable and cost-effective operations.

By addressing the limitations of existing tools—such as the lack of reliable virtualization support in EnergyMeter, the need for dual deployment in Kepler and PowerAPI, and container labeling issues in Scaphandre—EMT positions itself as a comprehensive, future-ready solution for energy monitoring in complex environments.

**Recommendations:**

- Ensure Linux kernel supports eBPF and RAPL permissions
- Integrate Prometheus export with existing observability stacks
- Use granular data for workload optimization
- Combine insights with resource management for energy efficiency
- Engage with the community for updates and feedback
