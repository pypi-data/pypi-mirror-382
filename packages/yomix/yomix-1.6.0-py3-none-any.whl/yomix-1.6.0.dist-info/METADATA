Yomix is an interactive tool to explore low dimensional embeddings of omics data.

As illustrated in the GIF below, users can explore embeddings—typically generated using dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP, t-SNE, TriMap, or VAEs. Within these visualizations, users can identify clusters of interest and use a lasso tool to define specific subsets. Yomix can then compute gene signatures for these subsets almost instantaneously. For instance, it can identify gene signatures that best distinguish subset A from the rest of the data, differentiate subset A from subset B, or find genes whose expression levels are most strongly correlated with a user-defined direction within subset A.

## INSTALL

In a python virtual environment, do:

    pip install yomix


Then try the tool with:

    yomix --example


To use it on your own files:

    yomix yourfile.h5ad

where `yourfile.h5ad` is an anndata object saved in h5ad format (see
 [anndata - Annotated data](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)), 
 with at least one `.obsm` field of dimension 2 or more (the low dimensional embedding).

When there are many samples in the dataset, the --subsampling option can be passed to improve reactiveness:

    yomix --subsampling N yourfile.h5ad

It randomly subsamples the dataset to a maximum number of N samples. For example:

    yomix --subsampling 5000 yourfile.h5ad


<details><summary> <b>Other option: INSTALL FROM SOURCE</b> </summary><p>

    git clone https://github.com/perrin-isir/yomix.git


We recommand to create a python environment with [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html),
but any python package manager can be used instead.

    cd yomix

    micromamba create --name yomixenv --file environment.yaml

    micromamba activate yomixenv

    pip install -e .


Then try the tool with:

    yomix yomix/example/pbmc.h5ad

The input file must be an anndata object saved in h5ad format (see
 [anndata - Annotated data](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)), 
 with at least one `.obsm` field of dimension 2 or more.

<details><summary> <b>Using Seurat objects with Yomix </b> </summary><p>


You can use Seurat objects by converting them to .h5ad format in R:

Load required libraries:
```
library(rhdf5)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
library(SeuratDisk)
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratData)
```
Load the object:
```
my_file <- readRDS("path.rds")
```
If it is a SingleCellExperiment object, convert to Seurat:
```
if (inherits(my_file, "SingleCellExperiment")) {
  my_file <- as.Seurat(my_file)
}
```
Save as H5Seurat:
```
SaveH5Seurat(my_file, filename = "filename.h5seurat")
```
Convert to .h5ad:
```
Convert("filename.h5seurat", dest = "h5ad", output.path = "/.h5ad")
```
