# ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$
${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ (/kju ʃɛf/) calculates effective Hamiltonians for quantum systems.
# Getting Started
 ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ can be installed using `pip`:
```sh
pip install qcheff
 ```

Detailed installation instruction are [provided here](user_guide/install.md). CuPy is required in order to use the GPU for computations.
