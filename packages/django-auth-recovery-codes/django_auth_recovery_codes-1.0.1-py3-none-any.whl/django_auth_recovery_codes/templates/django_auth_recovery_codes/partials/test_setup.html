            <strong>Optional:</strong> This is a one-time test to confirm that your code has been configured correctly by the backend. 
            It is not required, but recommended before relying on your codes. The form will only show up if you haven't verified your
            tests and will remaining till you do
        </p>

        <ul id="setup-verification-list" class="padding-left-md">
            <li>Enter any code you wish to test.</li>
            <li>The app will check with the backend to confirm whether the set-up is correct.</li>
            <li>This test does not use up one of your codes.</li>
            <li>If successful, you will see a confirmation message and this section will no longer be needed.</li>
            <li>If the set-up fails, delete the code batch, generate a new one, and try again.</li>
