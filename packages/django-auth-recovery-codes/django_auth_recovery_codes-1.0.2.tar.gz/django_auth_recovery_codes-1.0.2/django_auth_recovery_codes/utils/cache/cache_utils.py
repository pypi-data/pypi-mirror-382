# Utility functions for working with cache keys.

# This module centralises cache key generation and related helpers to ensure
# consistency across the codebase. By defining cache key formats in one place,
# we avoid duplication and reduce the risk of typos or mismatched naming
# conventions.

# Currently includes helpers for recovery code cache management.
