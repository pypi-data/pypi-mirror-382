# """
# view_helpers.py

# This file contains helper functions specific to the views.
# Generic things that are not specific to any view

# Purpose:
# - Keep views.py clean and uncluttered.
# - Provide functionality that is specific to the view logic.

# Notes:
# - Not a general-purpose utilities module.
# - Functions here are intended to work only with the views.
# - Can be expanded in the future with more view-specific helpers.

    Ensure a setup flag is present in the cache and add it if missing.

    The `enforce_types` decorator ensures that `cache_data` is a dictionary,
    `user` is a User instance, and `flag_name` is a string. If any argument
    has an incorrect type, a TypeError is raised automatically.

    Args:
        cache_data (dict): The cache dictionary where flags are stored.
        user (User): The user for whom the setup flag is being checked.
        flag_name (str): The key name for the flag in the cache.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the flag was missing and has been added, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        Exception: Re-raises any exception encountered during flag computation.
