class PurgedStatsCollector:
    """
    Collects and aggregates statistics during recovery code purge operations.

    This helper class tracks the results of purging recovery code batches,
    including how many codes were removed, how many batches were affected,
    and which batches were skipped. It also generates lightweight reports
    for each processed batch. that will be sent to the admin

    Typical usage example:
        collector = PurgeStatsCollector()

        for batch in batches:
            purged_count, is_empty, batch_id = batch.purge_expired_codes()

    Attributes:
        total_purged (int): Total number of codes purged across all batches.
        total_batches (int): Total number of batches that had codes purged.
        total_skipped (int): Total number of batches skipped (no codes purged).
        batch_reports (list[dict]): A list of reports, one per processed batch.
        logger: An option logger to log information to a file
