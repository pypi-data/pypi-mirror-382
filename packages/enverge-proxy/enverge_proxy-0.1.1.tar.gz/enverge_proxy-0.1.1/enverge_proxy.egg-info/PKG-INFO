# Enverge Proxy

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/enverge_proxy)](https://pypi.org/project/enverge_proxy/)

**Access powerful GPUs with no DevOps or infra configuration inside your current Google Colab notebooks.**

Connects Google Colab with the [Enverge Lab](https://lab.enverge.ai/signup?src=pypi) servers through a proxy, which runs on your local machine.

The proxy routes http://localhost:8123 to GPU-powered Enverge Lab instances.

The proxy should handle all ports, all types of TCP requests and authentication. By default, it uses the HTTPS port 443.
