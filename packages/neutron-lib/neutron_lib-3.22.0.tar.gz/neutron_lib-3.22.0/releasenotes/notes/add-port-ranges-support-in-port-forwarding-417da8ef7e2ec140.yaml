    Add new fields ``internal_port_range`` and ``external_port_range`` to
    allow users to create port forwardings using port ranges instead of
    creating the ports rules one by one.

    Update fields ``internal_port`` and ``external_port`` in floating ip
    portforwardings to be optional, as now you can chose between using them
    or the ``internal_port_range`` and ``external_port_range`` fields.
