    The ``qinq`` extension adds a ``qinq`` attribute to the network
    resource. This new attribute can be used in a similar way to
    ``vlan_transparent`` but networks created with ``qinq`` set will use
    ``0x8a88`` ethertype for the double vlan tagged traffic.
    Attributes ``qinq`` and ``vlan_transparent`` can't be used together
    for the same network.
