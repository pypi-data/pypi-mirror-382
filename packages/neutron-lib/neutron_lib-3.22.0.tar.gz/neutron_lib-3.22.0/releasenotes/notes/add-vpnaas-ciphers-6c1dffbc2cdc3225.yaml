    Added support for more ciphers to the neutron-vpnaas API.
    Added encryption algorithms (AES CCM and AES GCM modes for 128/192/256
    bit keys and 8/12/16 octet ICVs, e.g. aes-256-ccm-16, and AES CTR modes
    for 128/192/256 bit keys, e.g. aes-256-ctr),
    authentication algorithms (AES-XCBC, AES-CMAC) and PFS choices
    (Diffie Hellman groups 15 to 31).
