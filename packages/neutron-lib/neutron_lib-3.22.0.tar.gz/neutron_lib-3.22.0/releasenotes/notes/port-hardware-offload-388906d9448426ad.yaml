    The ``port-hardware-offload`` extension adds ``hardware_offload_type``
    attribute to the port resource. This new attribute stores the type
    of hardware offload the port is going to use and will be populated
    in the port binding profile information with
    "'capabilities': [<hardware_offload_type>]". This extension is still
    not read by Nova; this is the reason Neutron still populates the port
    binding profile. The value of this parameter will not be updated if
    the port binding profile information is updated.
