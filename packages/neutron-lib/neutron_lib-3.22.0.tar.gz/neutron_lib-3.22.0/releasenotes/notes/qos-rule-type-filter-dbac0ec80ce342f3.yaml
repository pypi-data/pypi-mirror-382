    Added API definition for ``qos-rule-type-filter`` extension that adds two
    new parameters to QoS rule type API: "all_supported" that is a flag to
    filter all supported QoS rule types by at least one loaded mechanism
    driver; "all_rules" that is a flag to filter all implemented QoS rule
    types in the Neutron server.
