    To guarantee the correct transition to SQLAlchemy 2.0, Neutron and
    neutron-lib set the SQL engine connection ``autocommit`` parameter to
    "False". Since SQLAlchemy 1.4, this parameter will default to "False";
    in SQLAlchemy 2.0, this will be the only value.
    If session ``autocommit`` is "False", the session transaction will not
    end at the end of a reader/writer context. In this case, a session could
    have an active transaction even when it is not inside a reader/writer
    context. In order to mimic the previous behaviour, this method checks
    the pending new, deleted and dirty elements to be flushed. In case of
    not having any pending command, the session is considered as non active.
