    A new field is added to the model query hooks: "rbac_actions". This field
    can modify the RBAC entries filter, setting the required RBAC actions for
    this specific model. This field is implemented initially for the "network"
    and the "subnet" model, that require an additional RBAC action
    ("access_as_external").
