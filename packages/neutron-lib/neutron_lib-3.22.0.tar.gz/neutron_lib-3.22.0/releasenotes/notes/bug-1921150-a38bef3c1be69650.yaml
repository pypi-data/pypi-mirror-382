    If you leave a long time window between upgrading Placement and Neutron
    Server, then it is recommended to upgrade Placement first (as was always
    the logical order since Neutron is a client of Placement).
    If the window between upgrading Neutron and Placement is short - that is
    no changes in (segments of routed networks and QoS) resources backed by
    Placement during this window you can ignore this note.

    Switched to using placement microversion 1.37 therefore we can fix the
    resource provider tree corrupted by bug
