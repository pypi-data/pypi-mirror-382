    New attribute ``has_global_access`` is added to the context object. Value of
    this attribute is set based on the API policy rule
    ``context_with_global_access`` and should be used in case when there are
    custom roles with access to the resources from all projects. For example,
    ``auditor`` role which should have read only access to all of the resources
    in the cloud.
    By default ``context.has_global_access`` is granted to no one.
