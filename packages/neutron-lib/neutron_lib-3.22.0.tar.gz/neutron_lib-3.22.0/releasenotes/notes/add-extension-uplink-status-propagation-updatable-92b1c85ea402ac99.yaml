    Add the API extension ``uplink-status-propagation-updatable`` to make the
    port field ``propagate_uplink_status`` updatable. Now it is possible to send
    a port PUT request to update the value defined during the creation. This
    change will have an effect in the ML2/SR-IOV agent that will need to update
    the VF status accordingly.
