    API resources which do not really have ``project_id`` associated with them,
    because either it belongs to the project to which their parent belongs (``QoS
    rules``) or does not belong to any project (``flavor`` and ``service
    profile``), do not accept ``project_id`` nor ``tenant_id`` to be sent in the
    body of the POST or PUT request.
