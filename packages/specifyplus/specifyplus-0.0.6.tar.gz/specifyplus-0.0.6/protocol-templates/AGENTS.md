# AGENTS.md

This project uses **Spec Kit Plus** for Spec-Driven Development.

## Dev Tips

1. Authoritative Source Mandate:

Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

2. Execution Flow:

Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

## Available Commands

Core workflow:
- `/sp.constitution` - Define project quality principles and governance
- `/sp.specify <feature>` - Create feature specification
- `/sp.plan` - Design architecture and technical approach
- `/sp.tasks` - Break down implementation into testable tasks
- `/sp.implement` - Execute tasks with TDD (red-green-refactor)

Knowledge capture:
- `/sp.phr [title]` - Record prompt history (automatic after all work)
- `/sp.adr [title]` - Document architecture decisions (suggested intelligently)

Analysis:
- `/sp.analyze` - Cross-check specs, plans, and tasks for consistency

## Automatic Documentation Protocol

**CRITICAL**: This project requires comprehensive knowledge capture for team learning, compliance, and pattern recognition.

### Prompt History Records (PHR) - Always Automatic

After completing ANY work, automatically create a PHR:

1. **Detect work type**: constitution|spec|architect|implementation|debugging|refactoring|discussion|general
2. **Generate title**: 3-7 word descriptive title summarizing the work
3. **Capture context**: COMPLETE conversation (never truncate to summaries)
4. **Route correctly**:
   - Pre-feature work ‚Üí `docs/prompts/`
   - Feature-specific work ‚Üí `specs/<feature>/prompts/`
5. **Confirm**: Show "üìù PHR-NNNN recorded"

**Documentation captures everything**:
- Design discussions and technical decisions
- Architecture planning and API design
- Implementation (new features, debugging, refactoring)
- Problem-solving and troubleshooting
- Code reviews and optimizations
- Questions, clarifications, exploratory conversations
- **All development activity** - complete history

**Only exception**: Skip PHR for `/sp.phr` command itself (prevents recursion).

**Technical execution**:
- Use `.**/commands/sp.phr.md` template for creation
- Preserve FULL context - never truncate
- On error: warn but don't block workflow

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After completing design/architecture work, analyze for ADR significance:

**Three-part significance test** (ALL must be true):

1. **Impact**: Technical decision with long-term consequences?
   - Examples: Framework choice, data model design, API architecture, security approach, deployment platform

2. **Alternatives**: Multiple viable options were considered/debated?
   - Shows deliberation, not just default choices
   - Tradeoffs were weighed

3. **Scope**: Cross-cutting concern affecting multiple components or future decisions?
   - Not isolated implementation detail
   - Influences system design broadly

**If ALL conditions met**, suggest:
```
üìã Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`
```

**Wait for user consent** - never auto-create ADRs.

**User may decline if**:
- Decision is obvious or standard practice
- Temporary/experimental (will change soon)
- Already documented in existing ADR

**ADR Granularity Principle**:
Document decision CLUSTERS, not atomic choices.

‚úÖ **Good**: "Frontend Technology Stack" (Next.js + Tailwind + Vercel as integrated solution)
‚ùå **Bad**: Separate ADRs for Next.js, Tailwind, and Vercel

Group related technologies that:
- Work together as integrated solution
- Would likely change together
- Share rationale and tradeoffs

Separate ADRs only when decisions are independent and could diverge.

**Examples**:
- Technology stacks: Frontend stack, Backend stack, Data layer
- Authentication: Protocol + library + session strategy (ONE ADR)
- Deployment: Platform + CI/CD + monitoring (ONE ADR)

## Project Structure

- `docs/constitution.md` - Project principles (quality, testing, performance, governance)
- `specs/<feature>/spec.md` - Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- `specs/<feature>/plan.md` - Architecture design and technical decisions
- `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` - Implementation breakdown with test cases
- `docs/prompts/` - Development history records (PHRs)
- `docs/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `.specify/` - Spec Kit templates and scripts

## Workflow Pattern

```
1. Define principles    ‚Üí /sp.constitution
2. Specify feature      ‚Üí /sp.specify "User authentication"
3. Plan architecture    ‚Üí /sp.plan
4. Review decisions     ‚Üí /sp.adr (if prompted after planning)
5. Break into tasks     ‚Üí /sp.tasks
6. Implement with TDD   ‚Üí /sp.implement
```

After each step: PHR automatically created, ADRs suggested when appropriate.

## Code Standards

See `docs/constitution.md` for project-specific:
- Code quality requirements
- Testing standards (coverage, categories, TDD enforcement)
- Performance expectations
- Security guidelines
- Architecture principles

## Notes for Generic Agents

If your agent doesn't support Spec Kit commands natively:
1. Read `docs/constitution.md` for project principles
2. Check `specs/*/spec.md` for feature requirements
3. Review `specs/*/plan.md` for architecture decisions
4. Follow `specs/*/tasks.md` for implementation order
5. Respect automatic documentation protocol above

## Error Handling

- PHR creation errors: Warn but don't block workflow
- ADR creation errors: Report and allow manual creation
- Missing directories: Auto-create as needed
- Invalid stage detection: Fall back to 'general' stage
