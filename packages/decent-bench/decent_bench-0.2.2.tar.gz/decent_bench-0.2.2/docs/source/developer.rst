Developer Guide
===============
Want to contribute to decent-bench? That's great! This guide contains useful information
about development tools, processes, and rules.



Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `Python 3.13+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
* `tox <https://pypi.org/project/tox/>`_

Installation for Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/team-decent/decent-bench.git
   cd decent-bench
   tox -e dev                     # create dev env
   source .tox/dev/bin/activate   # activate dev env



Tooling
-------
The dev environment created with :code:`tox -e dev` has all dependencies and dev-dependencies installed. After
activating the dev environment, various tools can be run. Examples include:

.. code-block:: bash

    mypy decent_bench --strict      # find typing issues
    pytest test                     # run tests
    ruff check decent_bench --fix   # find and fix style issues
    ruff format decent_bench        # format code
    make -C docs html               # rebuild html doc files
    tox -e sphinx                   # rebuild rst and html doc files
    tox                             # run all GitHub status checks

To verify that doc changes look good, use an html previewer such as
`Live Preview <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server>`_.



CUTE Design Principles
----------------------
CUTE is a set of principles that serve as guidelines for code design. They are meant to help keep the
codebase simple and the development fast. To mitigate any conflict, the principles are ordered from most to least
important:

1.  **Correctness**: working code is the top priority.
2.  **Understandability**: others should easily understand your code, avoid bloat, unnecessary indirection, and fancy
    abstractions.
3.  **Testability**: code allows for short and clear tests.
4.  **Extendability**: code allows for future extension, but avoid premature generalization and keep YAGNI and KISS in
    mind as trying to predict tomorrow's requirements can cause more problems than it solves.



Pull Requests
-------------
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Update documentation as needed.
5. Run :code:`tox` to ensure that all checks pass.
6. Submit a pull request.
7. Doc changes? Click the readthedocs link found in the status checks to verify that everything looks good.



Commit Messages
---------------
To keep the git history easy to follow, encourage well-scoped PRs, and facilitate changelog writing and versioning, we
follow certain rules for commit messages when merging pull requests into main. Each message uses this template:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Template

    <type>(<scope>): <subject> (#<pr-id>)

    <description>

    closes #<issue-id>

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Example

    perf(costs): Cache m_cvx and m_smooth (#105)

    Cache the properties m_cvx and m_smooth where applicable. This led to a
    75% speed up when running ADMM on a logistic regression problem.

    closes #101

Notes:
    - See table below for types.
    - Scope can be a subpackage, module or build tool, e.g. metrics, costs, or sphinx.
    - Max 72 characters per line.
    - Capitalize but do not punctuate subject.
    - Use imperative mood in subject and description.
    - Description explains what changes and why it changes.
    - If the PR has a related issue but doesn't close it, skip the "closes"-keyword and simply reference the issue.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 40
    :header-rows: 1
    
    * - Type
      - Description
    * - feat

Releases
--------
1. Update the version in pyproject.toml using `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.
2. Merge the change into main with commit message :code:`meta: Bump version to <x>.<y>.<z> (#<pr-id>)`.
3. Create a new release on GitHub.
4. Publish to PyPI using :code:`hatch clean && hatch build && hatch publish`.
