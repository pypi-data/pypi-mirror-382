No additional configuration is required. This module installs automatically when dependencies are met.

Auto-Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module is configured with ``auto_install=True`` and will be automatically 
installed when both dependencies are present:

* ``product_logistics_uom``
* ``product_net_weight``

Manual installation is not required - the system will automatically detect when 
both modules are installed and provide the compatibility layer seamlessly.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Enable "Manage Multiple Units of Measure" in Inventory settings
* Ensure proper weight UoM categories are configured in your system

The integration works automatically once dependencies are met.
