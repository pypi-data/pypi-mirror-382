==================
Mg II Dopplergrams
==================

In this example we are going to produce a Dopplergram for the Mg II k line from a
400-step raster. The Dopplergram is obtained by subtracting the intensities at
symmetrical velocity shifts from the line core (e.g., Â±50 km/s).

#
# To better understand the orbital velocity problem, let us look at how the

# Some residual shift remains, but we will not correct for it here. A more
# elaborate correction can be obtained by the IDL routine
# ``iris_prep_wavecorr_l2``, but this has not yet been ported to Python

# tutorial <http://iris.lmsal.com/itn26/tutorials.html#mg-ii-dopplergrams>`__

# We can use the calibrated data for example to calculate Dopplergrams. A
# Dopplergram is here defined as the difference between the intensities at
# two wavelength positions at the same (and opposite) distance from the
# line core. For example, at +/- 50 km/s from the Mg II k3 core. To do
# this, let us first calculate a velocity scale for the k line and find
# the indices of the -50 and +50 km/s velocity positions (here using the
# convention of negative velocities for up flows):

velocity = (mg_wave - mg_k_centre) * c / mg_k_centre
