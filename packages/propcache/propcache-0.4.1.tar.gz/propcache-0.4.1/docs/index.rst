propcache
=========

The module provides accelerated versions of ``cached_property``

Introduction
------------

Usage
-----

The API is designed to be nearly identical to the built-in ``cached_property`` class,
except for the additional ``under_cached_property`` class which uses ``self._cache``
instead of ``self.__dict__`` to store the cached values and prevents ``__set__`` from being called.
