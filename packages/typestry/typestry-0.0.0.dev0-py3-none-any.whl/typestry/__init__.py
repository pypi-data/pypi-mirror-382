"""Top-level package for Typestry.

Typestry provides a framework for testing Python type checkers.  It allows you
to specify code samples along with expectations about whether they should
produce type checking errors.  This helps ensure that type checkers behave as
anticipated, catching incorrect types and allowing correct code to pass.

This package is currently a stub and does not contain any functional
implementation.  Contributions are welcome!
