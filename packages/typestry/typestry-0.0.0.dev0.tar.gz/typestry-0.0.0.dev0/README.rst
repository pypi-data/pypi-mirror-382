Typestry
========

A tool for verifying that Python type checkers fail or pass exactly when expected.
The goal of this project is to test type checker implementations by asserting that
errors occur when they should and that valid code passes without complaint.

This repository is based off the `paradigms` template and provides a minimal
package structure, continuous integration via GitHub Actions, and configuration
for development tools such as mypy, pytest and ruff. It serves as a starting
point for building more comprehensive tests of type checker conformance.

.. note:: This project is a work in progress and is provided as a stub for
   further development.
