[CDF-25781] üòÅ Use YAML classes (#2045)

# Description

These classes are already implemented and well tested. Setting the
yaml_cls in the CRUD interfac will start using this in the build command
to validate the YAML syntax of the user. The motivation for doing this
in a separate PR is to avoid merge conflicts.

This is the same type of PR as for example #1944, #1994

## Details:
The testing of the YAML resource classes we use to validate the syntax
of the user configurations:
https://github.com/cognitedata/toolkit/tree/main/tests/test_unit/test_cdf_tk/test_resource_classes

Then, by setting yaml_cls in the resource CRUDit will be used in the cdf
build command to give the user a warning about whether they follow the
syntax here:
