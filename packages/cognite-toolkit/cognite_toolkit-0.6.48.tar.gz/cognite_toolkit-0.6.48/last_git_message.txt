[CDF-25198] üòÅ Improved purge space part 4 (#2034)

# Description

This is part 4 of reimplementing the `cdf purge space` commands. This
flips the purge application to use the new command.

The motivation for this reimplementation is as follows:
* The `/data-modeling/statistics` endpoint makes dry-run a lot faster to
implement, but requires a new approach.
* We have new components such as HTTPClient and WorkerProducer that will
be very useful for running the purge code.
* The current implementation lacks proper testing, a reimplementation
will ensure it is well tested.

### Improved

- The `cdf purge space` command has been reworked. The command now has
an improved user experience for selecting space. It is a log faster when
running in `--dry-run`, and it does not delete timeseries datapoints and
files by default anymore.
