About RPC III
=============

The RPC III file format, developed by MTS Systems Corporation, is widely used in vehicle durability
testing and simulation. This format is structured as sequential, fixed-length files, with each record
being 512 bytes. The file consists of a standard header followed by data records. The header typically
includes metadata such as the file creation date, channel information, and other configuration details
stored as keyword-value pairs.

The format supports up to 256 data channels and 1024 parameters, with specific limitations on property
names (maximum 32 characters) and values (maximum 96 characters). These files are often used in
conjunction with MTS's RPC Pro and RPC Connect software, which facilitate the analysis and simulation
of vehicle response to road conditions.

To work with RPC III files, tools like the MTS DataPlugin are available, allowing for the reading and
writing of these files within different software environments, such as National Instruments' LabVIEW.
The files typically carry extensions like .rsp or .tim.

If you're looking for a more detailed description of the format or specific documentation, it's usually
included in the software manuals provided by MTS or in the release notes of tools like the MTS


About this module
=================

This module provides functionality to read and write time history data from
RPC III format data files, commonly used in vehicle durability testing.
The module supports the extraction and modification of metadata, such as
channel information and test parameters, as well as the ability to handle
the structured data records stored within these files.

Key Features:
-------------
- Read and parse RPC III (.rsp, .tim) files.
- Write data and metadata back to RPC III files.
- Support for up to 256 data channels and 1024 parameters.
- Handles fixed-length records with standard headers.

Typical usage example:
----------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from scipy import integrate
    import rpc3

    # Read data from an RPC III file
    filename = "samplefile.rpc"
    data = rpc3.to_dict(rpc3.read(filename)[0])

    # Modify data or metadata as needed
    dt = data["V_CGES"].dt
    t = data["V_CGES"].time()
    data["V_CGES"].data /= 3.6
    data["V_CGES"].unit = "m/s"
    data["new_channel"] = (
        rpc3.Channel(
            name="distance",
            unit="m",
            data=integrate.cumulative_trapezoid(data["V_CGES"].data, dx=dt),
            dt=dt
        )
    )

    # Write the modified data back to an RPC III file
    rpc3.write('modified_data.rsp', list(data.values()))


RPC III File Format Summary
===========================

The RPC III file format is used to read, write, and import data in various file types related to time history,
histograms, and other data. The format is structured around sequential, fixed-length, 512-byte records and
includes a standard header followed by data blocks. There is no end-of-file character in these binary files,
except for configuration files, which only contain a header.

File Headers
------------
RPC III file headers provide essential metadata about the data contained within the file.
These headers consist of ASCII records stored in 512-byte blocks, with each record containing a keyword-value
pair that is 128 bytes long. Keywords can be up to 32 bytes, and values can be up to 96 bytes, both including
null terminators. These headers are crucial for RPC III programs, which use byte arrays for string
manipulation in both C and FORTRAN environments.

The first three records in any RPC III file header—FORMAT, NUM_HEADER_BLOCKS, and NUM_PARAMS—are
position-sensitive, meaning they must appear in specific positions. Subsequent records can be placed
arbitrarily, though certain descriptors should be grouped for faster access. The number of header records
is not fixed and can be expanded as needed, limited only by available disk space.

File Types
----------
RPC III supports various file types, including TIME_HISTORY, CONFIGURATION (a subset of TIME_HISTORY), MATRIX,
FATIGUE, ROAD_SURFACE, SPECTRAL, and START. Each file type can contain multiple kinds of files, identified
by specific keyword-value pairs in the header. For instance, different kinds of time histories within a
TIME_HISTORY file are distinguished by the TIME_TYPE keyword.
In this module, only TIME_HISTORY datasets are supported.

Data Organization
-----------------
In TIME_HISTORY files, data is organized into groups and frames. Frames can contain between 256 and 16,384 data
points, while groups range from 2,048 to 16,384 data points. Data is demultiplexed, meaning that each block of
data contains sequential data points for multiple channels. The last block in a data sequence may not be
completely filled, with any remaining points set to zero. Normally, the remaining points are are filled with
the last value of the actual time series, so that when reading back the file it is easier to distinguish between
real zero values and zeros that are used to fill the end gap.

This summary provides an overview of the RPC III file format, including its organization, header structure,
and data management. This format is designed to be flexible and expandable, accommodating various data types
and storage requirements.
