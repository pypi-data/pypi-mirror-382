Gallery Examples
================

This page demonstrates the integration between Sphinx Gallery and Marimo. Each example below shows a static version generated by Sphinx Gallery, along with download links and a **launch marimo** button for interactive exploration.

What is Sphinx Gallery?
------------------------

`Sphinx Gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/>`_ is a popular extension that automatically generates beautiful documentation from Python scripts. It executes your code, captures the output and plots, and creates nicely formatted HTML pages with:

- Syntax-highlighted source code
- Rendered plots and visualizations
- Execution output and timing information
- Download links for Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks

The examples are automatically generated from Python scripts in the ``gallery_examples/`` directory. Sphinx Gallery executes each script, captures the output, and generates static documentation pages.

Integration with Marimo
------------------------

The sphinx-marimo extension enhances Sphinx Gallery by adding a **launch marimo** button to each example. When you click this button, you open an interactive version of the notebook that runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly - no server required!

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Static Documentation**: Beautiful rendered examples with syntax highlighting and output (via Sphinx Gallery)
- **Download Options**: Get the original Python script or Jupyter notebook version (via Sphinx Gallery)
- **Interactive Launch**: Click "launch marimo" to explore with live widgets and real-time updates (via sphinx-marimo)
- **Seamless Integration**: Buttons automatically appear alongside existing Binder/JupyterLite options

.. note::
   The Marimo launcher integration requires no changes to existing Gallery examples -
   it works automatically with any Gallery-compatible Python script.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can control which buttons appear on Gallery pages using these configuration options in ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   # Control button visibility (both default to True)
   marimo_show_footer_button = True   # Show download button in page footer
   marimo_show_sidebar_button = True  # Show launch button in right sidebar

This allows you to choose whether users see the download button, the launch button, or both.
