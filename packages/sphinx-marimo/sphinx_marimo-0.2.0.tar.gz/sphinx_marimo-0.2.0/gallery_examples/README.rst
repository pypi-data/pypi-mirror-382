Gallery Examples
================

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the integration between
Sphinx Gallery and Marimo. Each script creates static visualizations that are
automatically rendered by Sphinx Gallery, while also providing a "launch marimo"
button for interactive exploration.

The examples showcase:

* **Basic Visualization**: Simple plotting with mathematical functions
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Multi-panel dashboard with various chart types
* **Machine Learning Demo**: Classification workflow with model evaluation

Each example is designed to work both as static documentation and as an
interactive Marimo notebook.
