2.0.1 (August 15th, 2024)
-------------------------

* Fix sentry-sdk deprecation error with ``sentry_sdk.Hub``. (#66)


2.0.0 (June 12th, 2024)
-----------------------

* Support sentry-sdk >2 (#51)

  This reworks fillmore to work with sentry-sdk >2 which made a lot of
  internal API changes.

  Because of how the sentry-sdk changed, this commit introduces a set of
  backwards-incompatible changes to fillmore--mostly in the test module:

  * fillmore no longer works with sentry-sdk <2

  * ``fillmore.test.SentryTestHelper`` transport captures envelopes sent to
    ``/envelope`` and no longer captures events sent to ``/store``

  * removed ``fillmore.test.SentryTestHelper.events`` property and replaced
    ``fillmore.test.SentryTestHelper.envelopes`` and
    ``fillmore.test.SentryTestHelper.envelope_payloads``. The latter is much
    like what ``.events`` returned

    For example, this::

       # stuff happens
       assert len(sentry_helper.events) == 1
       assert sentry_helper.events[0] == {
           "breadcrumbs": ...
           ...
       }

    becomes this::

       # stuff happens
       assert len(sentry_helper.envelopes) == 1
       assert sentry_helper.envelope_payloads[0] == {
           "breadcrumbs": ...
           ...
       }

  * generalized ``fillmore.test.diff_event`` to
    ``fillmore.test.diff_structure``

    It works the same, but it's not event-centric anymore. It works
    with ``envelope.payload.json`` data.


1.3.0 (June 10th, 2024)
-----------------------

* Switch project to use ruff for formatting. (#42)

* Switch project to use pyproject for project configuration. (#43)

* Pin sentry-sdk support to ``sentry-sdk<2``. Fillmore 2.x will support
  ``sentry-sdk>2``, but it requires backwards incompatible changes. (#51)

* Add support for Django 5.0 (#53)

* Drop support for Django 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2 (#54)


1.2.0 (November 6th, 2023)
--------------------------

* Add support for Python 3.12 (#32)

* Add support for Django 4.2 (#33)


1.1.0 (April 5th, 2023)
-----------------------

* Switch from flake8 to ruff (#24)

* Add ``fillmore.test.diff_event`` utilify function for comparing a Sentry
  event with an expected structure accounting for ``unittest.mock.ANY``. (#23)


1.0.0 (November 8th, 2022)
--------------------------

* Add support for Python 3.11 (#18)

This feels stable and I'm using it in multiple production real-world projects,
so releasing a 1.0.0.


0.1.2 (August 1st, 2022)
------------------------

* Fix examples in documentation so they're linted and tested. Add notes about
  ``fillmore`` logging. Rewrite testing chapter to introduce Fillmore testing
  features in a less muddled way. (#15)


0.1.1 (July 25th, 2022)
-----------------------

* Fix scrubber where paths that were valid, but didn't point to something in an
  event erroneously kicked up a RulePathError. (#12)

* Fix test examples in docs.

* Fix examples in README. Thanks @stevejalim!


0.1.0 (June 23rd, 2022)
-----------------------

* Inital extraction and writing.
