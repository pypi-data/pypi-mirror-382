= srcignore

`srcignore` is a Typer-based CLI that reports which files inside a project match
one or more `.gitignore`-style files.

== Installation

[source,console]
----
pip install .
----

Running the tool from source without installing works too:

[source,console]
----
PYTHONPATH=src python -m srcignore --help
----

== Usage

[source,console]
----
srcignore ls PROJECT_ROOT IGNORE_FILE... [--reverse]
----

* `PROJECT_ROOT` — directory to traverse recursively.
* `IGNORE_FILE` — one or more files containing `.gitignore`-style patterns.

By default the command prints each path, relative to `PROJECT_ROOT`, that is
matched by any provided ignore file.

Pass `--reverse` to instead print paths that are *not* matched by at least one
provided ignore file. This is handy for spotting files that would be kept by
your ignore rules.

== Examples

List everything that would be ignored by `.gitignore`:

[source,console]
----
srcignore ls . .gitignore
----

Review files that are *not* matched by `.gitignore` and `.srcignore`:

[source,console]
----
srcignore ls . .gitignore .srcignore --reverse
----
