# Conservative Estimation Guide for Solution Space

## Acceptable Estimation Methods

### Time/Resource Estimates
```
✅ "X-Y person-months `[AI estimation based on similar integration complexity]`"
✅ "Implementation timeline: N weeks `[AI estimation: standard API development cycles]`"
❌ "6 months" (without estimation tag)
❌ "Requires 5 developers" (without complexity justification)
```

### Financial Estimates
```
✅ "Cost range: $X-Y `[AI estimation: conservative hourly rate × effort estimate]`"
✅ "Potential savings `[AI estimation based on time liberation × org hourly rates]`"
❌ "$50,000 implementation cost" (without derivation)
❌ "ROI of 200%" (without calculation basis)
```

### Performance Improvements
```
✅ "40-50% efficiency gain `[AI estimation based on manual task elimination]`"
✅ "Time reduction potential `[AI estimation based on automation scope]`"
❌ "75% faster processing" (without baseline reference)
❌ "Guaranteed 3x improvement" (without uncertainty acknowledgment)
```

### Technology Complexity
```
✅ "Medium complexity `[AI assessment: standard API + custom logic required]`"
✅ "High integration effort `[AI estimation based on multi-platform requirements]`"
❌ "Easy implementation" (without technical justification)
❌ "Complex system" (without specific complexity factors)
```

## Conservative Language Patterns
- Use ranges instead of precise numbers: "40-50%" not "47%"
- Acknowledge uncertainty: "`[Uncertain: requires validation]`"
- Reference methodology: "`[AI estimation based on X]`"
- Provide context: "similar to previous Y implementations"
- Include caveats: "assuming standard conditions"

## Forbidden Phrases
❌ "Will save exactly..."
❌ "Guaranteed ROI of..."
❌ "Costs precisely..."
❌ "Takes exactly..."
❌ "Improves performance by..."

## Approved Alternatives
✅ "Potential savings range..."
✅ "Estimated ROI potential..."
✅ "Cost range based on..."
✅ "Timeline estimate considering..."
✅ "Performance improvement potential..."
