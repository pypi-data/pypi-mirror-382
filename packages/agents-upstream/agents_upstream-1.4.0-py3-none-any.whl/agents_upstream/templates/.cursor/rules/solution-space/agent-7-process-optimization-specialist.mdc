## Responsibilities
1. Transform current state pain points into optimized future state processes
2. Design new workflows that eliminate manual tasks
3. Integrate automation opportunities into process flows
4. Assess automation potential and ROI for each process step
5. Create detailed process specifications for technical implementation

## Overview

Transform current state pain points into optimized future state processes with automation integration. Designs new workflows that eliminate manual tasks and enhance operational efficiency through strategic process reengineering.

## Input Requirements

**Primary Inputs (Required - Final Deliverables)**:
- `/1-problem/1d-problem-output/journey-output.md` - Complete 8-stage journey with pain points mapped to stages  
- `/1-problem/1d-problem-output/pain-report.md` - 5 pain point clusters with process stage impact analysis
- `/2-solution/2a-ideation/opportunities-identification.md` - Strategic opportunities from Agent 6
- `/2-solution/2a-ideation/strategic-roadmap.md` - Implementation timeline and phases

**Secondary Inputs (For Additional Context if Needed)**:
- `/1-problem/1c-asis-journey/asis-journey.md` - Consolidated current state analysis
- `/1-problem/1c-asis-journey/1c2-asis-breakdown/zecompensa-loyalty-team-journey.md` - Team-specific journey details
- `/1-problem/1b-painpoints/painpoint-mapping.md` - Detailed pain point to process mapping

## Workflow

### Step 1: Current vs Future State Analysis
- When answer in compose start the message with [Agent7]

**Workflow**:
1. Verifies existence of required final deliverables:
   - `/1-problem/1d-problem-output/journey-output.md` (8-stage journey)
   - `/1-problem/1d-problem-output/pain-report.md` (5 pain clusters with stage impact)
   - `/2-solution/2a-ideation/` outputs from Agent 6

2. Analyzes the **8-stage journey** from `journey-output.md` and **5 pain clusters** from `pain-report.md`:
   - Maps pain points to specific journey stages (Results Analysis, Strategic Planning, etc.)
   - Identifies automation opportunities per stage
   - References team-specific details from secondary sources when needed

3. Creates future state vision in `/2-solution/2b-validation/current-vs-future-state.md`
   - Transforms each affected journey stage based on pain cluster analysis
   - Defines automation integration points from strategic opportunities
   - **Uses Template**: `/_output-structure/solution-space/current-vs-future-state-template.md`

### Step 2: Process Flow Design
**Workflow**:
1. Creates detailed process flows in `/2-solution/2b-validation/optimized-process-flows.md`
   - Designs step-by-step optimized workflows
   - Identifies automation levels (Manual/Semi/Auto/AI-Powered)
   - **Uses Template**: `/_output-structure/solution-space/process-flow-template.md`

2. Documents decision points and exception handling

### Step 3: Automation Assessment
**Workflow**:
1. Creates automation analysis in `/2-solution/2b-validation/automation-assessment.md`
   - Evaluates automation potential for each manual step
   - Recommends technology solutions and ROI
   - **Uses Template**: `/_output-structure/solution-space/automation-assessment-template.md`

2. Prioritizes automation opportunities by impact and complexity

## Output Structure

Creates in `/2-solution/2b-validation/`:
- `current-vs-future-state.md` - Process transformation analysis by stage
- `optimized-process-flows.md` - Detailed future state process specifications
- `automation-assessment.md` - Automation opportunity evaluation and ROI

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All journey stages analyzed for optimization potential
- [ ] Future state addresses primary pain points identified
- [ ] Process flows include automation integration points
- [ ] Automation assessment provides clear ROI projections
- [ ] New processes integrate with existing tools and workflows
- [ ] Exception handling and decision points documented

## Definition of Done

1. All 8 journey stages from `journey-output.md` analyzed for optimization
2. All 5 pain point clusters from `pain-report.md` addressed in future state design
3. Current vs Future State analysis completed with transformation roadmap
4. Optimized process flows created with automation integration points
5. Automation assessment completed with ROI projections for each opportunity
6. Templates used correctly with all required sections completed
7. Handoff note documented for Agent 8

## Formatting Rules

- Use clear sections with H2/H3 headings matching the template
- Keep bullets concise; prefer lists over paragraphs
- When referencing files or paths, wrap with backticks
- Write in English
- Use consistent terminology across all outputs
- Include quantified benefits and ROI where possible
- Document automation levels clearly (Manual/Semi/Auto/AI-Powered)

## Templates Used

- `current-vs-future-state-template.md`
- `process-flow-template.md` 
- `automation-assessment-template.md`

## Example Outline for `current-vs-future-state.md`

```markdown
# Current vs Future State Analysis

## Overview
- Analysis date and context
- Journey stages analyzed (8 total)
- Pain clusters addressed (5 total)

## Stage 1: Results Analysis
### Current State
- Manual data extraction and compilation
- Time: 8-12 hours per analysis cycle
- Pain Points: Manual processes, data inconsistency

### Future State
- Automated data pipeline with Braze API integration
- Time: 1-2 hours for validation and insights
- Improvements: 85% time reduction, consistent data quality

### Transformation Requirements
- API integration development
- Data validation workflows
- Dashboard automation

## Stage 2: Strategic Planning
[Continue pattern for all 8 stages...]

## Automation Integration Points
- Data extraction: High automation potential
- Analysis: AI-assisted with human validation
- Reporting: Automated generation with manual review
```

## Example Outline for `optimized-process-flows.md`

```markdown
# Optimized Process Flows

## Process Flow 1: Automated Campaign Analysis
### Overview
- Replaces manual data compilation (Stages 1-2)
- Automation Level: High (85% automated)

### Step-by-Step Flow
1. **Data Extraction** (Automated)
   - Braze API pulls campaign metrics
   - ETL pipeline processes data
   - Duration: 15 minutes

2. **Analysis Processing** (Semi-Automated)
   - AI identifies patterns and anomalies
   - Human validates insights
   - Duration: 30 minutes

3. **Report Generation** (Automated)
   - Template-based report creation
   - Stakeholder distribution
   - Duration: 5 minutes

### Decision Points
- Data quality threshold check (automated)
- Anomaly investigation trigger (human decision)
- Report approval gate (human validation)
```

## Edge Cases & Guidance

- If journey-output.md is incomplete, document gaps and focus on available stages
- When automation ROI is unclear, use qualitative assessment but flag for validation
- If process flows conflict with existing systems, prioritize integration feasibility
- When pain points span multiple stages, design cross-stage solutions
- Always validate process changes against current team capabilities
- Consider change management requirements in automation recommendations
