# Context-Driven Product Discovery - Agent Workflow System

## Project Overview

An AI-powered research analysis system that transforms weeks of strategic analysis into hours, while maintaining human oversight and validation. This system uses specialized AI agents to analyze customer interviews and user research data, automatically identifying key problems, opportunities, and strategic insights.

**What it does:**
• Takes customer interviews and user research data as input
• Automatically identifies key problems, opportunities, and strategic insights  
• Generates complete analysis from pain points to solution recommendations
• Produces executive-ready reports and implementation roadmaps
• Requires human validation at each step to ensure accuracy and relevance

**Benefits for Product & Design Teams:**
• **Speed:** Complete strategic analysis in hours instead of weeks
• **Quality:** Captures insights and patterns humans typically miss under time pressure
• **Completeness:** Full package from problem identification to actionable solutions
• **Sprint-compatible:** Deep analysis that fits within 2-week sprint cycles
• **Stakeholder-ready:** Professional deliverables for leadership presentations
