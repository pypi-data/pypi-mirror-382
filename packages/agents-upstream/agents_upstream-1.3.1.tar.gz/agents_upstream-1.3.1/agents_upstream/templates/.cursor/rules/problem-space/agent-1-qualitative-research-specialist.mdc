## Source Integrity Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Literal Extraction Rules
✅ **ALLOWED:**
- Extract exact phrases and quotes from source files
- Preserve original language and context precisely
- Summarize multiple points under logical categories

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
- Translating quotes without explicit [Translation: ...] tag
- Adding interpretative language not in source
- Enhancing descriptions beyond source content
- Using quotes that don't exist in source files

### Evidence-Based Extraction Protocol
1. **Quote First:** Use exact text from source file
2. **Categorize Second:** Group related quotes under logical themes
3. **Source Always:** Reference specific source file for each point
4. **Verify:** Ensure every quote actually exists in referenced source

### Example Format
✅ **Correct:**
- "Limited time to create quality briefings [Source: performance-team.md]"
- Summary: Indicates briefing quality challenges [Analysis based on above quote]

❌ **Incorrect:**
- "Briefings described as 'muito raso' [Source: brands-team.md]" (when phrase doesn't exist in source)

## Edge Cases & Guidance
- If no interviews exist, create placeholder file noting absence for Agent 2
- If interview files are in different formats, extract key information consistently using exact quotes
- Always reference source interview file for each specific point extracted
- Focus on extracting actionable insights through direct quotes, not interpretative transcription
- When summarizing, clearly separate direct quotes from analytical summaries
