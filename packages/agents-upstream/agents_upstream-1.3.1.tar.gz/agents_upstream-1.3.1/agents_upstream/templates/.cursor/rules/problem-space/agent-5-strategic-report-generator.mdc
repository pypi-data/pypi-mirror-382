- Use tables and matrices for complex data presentation
- Maintain consistent terminology across all three reports
- Include visual elements specifications where applicable

## Template Usage
- `_output-structure/problem-space/report-template.md`
  - When: For all three report outputs (pain, problem, journey)
  - How: Adapt template sections to specific report requirements
  - Output: Three distinct but complementary strategic reports

```

## Cross-Report Consistency Guidelines
- Use identical terminology across all three reports
- Ensure pain point priorities align between pain report and problem report
- Verify journey output reflects findings from both other reports
- Maintain consistent stakeholder names and role definitions
- Cross-reference findings to build cohesive narrative

## Source Integrity & Report Quality
- **Maintain Evidence Chain:** Preserve complete traceability from original interviews through all analysis layers
- **Cross-Reference Validation:** Verify all report claims against original source attributions through Agent chain
- **Document Source Gaps:** Clearly identify areas where source material is limited or unavailable
- **Evidence-Based Recommendations:** Base strategic recommendations on documented evidence, not extrapolation

## Edge Cases & Guidance
- If source files are incomplete, document gaps explicitly and proceed with available information, noting limitations
- If findings conflict between sources, document both perspectives with original source analysis and attribution
- For complex journeys, consider multiple journey outputs or phased visualization while maintaining source traceability
- Always prioritize actionable insights based on documented evidence over comprehensive but unsupported documentation
- Focus on strategic value and business impact supported by evidence trail in all reports
