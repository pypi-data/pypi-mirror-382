# Solution Space Guardrails Enforcement

## üö´ ZERO TOLERANCE VIOLATIONS - NEVER ALLOWED

### Financial Estimates Without Sources
‚ùå "$50,000 implementation cost"  
‚ùå "ROI of 200%"  
‚ùå "$X-Y investment required"  
‚ùå "Saves $Z annually"

‚úÖ **Approved Alternatives:**
- "Substantial investment `[AI estimation: enterprise automation scope]`"
- "Strong ROI potential `[AI estimation based on efficiency gains]`" 
- "Significant annual value `[AI estimation based on operational improvement]`"

### Specific Performance Claims Without Basis
‚ùå "Will reduce costs by 75%"  
‚ùå "Guaranteed 3x improvement"  
‚ùå "Increases productivity by 50%"

‚úÖ **Approved Alternatives:**
- "Substantial efficiency improvement `[AI estimation based on manual task elimination]`"
- "Significant performance enhancement potential `[AI estimation based on process optimization]`"

## ‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

### Every Quantitative Statement Must Have:
1. **AI Estimation Tag:** `[AI estimation based on X]`
2. **Source Reference:** `[Source: filename.md]` (when applicable)
3. **Conservative Language:** "potential", "estimated", "projected"
4. **Uncertainty Acknowledgment:** When appropriate

### Approved Financial Language Patterns:
- "Moderate investment" / "High investment" / "Substantial investment"  
- "Significant annual value" / "Substantial annual savings"
- "Strong ROI potential" / "Attractive return potential"
- "Performance improvement value" / "Strategic value creation"

### Approved Performance Language Patterns:
- "40-50% efficiency gain `[AI estimation based on manual task elimination]`"
- "Substantial time reduction `[AI estimation based on automation scope]`" 
- "Significant quality improvement potential `[AI estimation based on process standardization]`"

## üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Delivery Requirements:
- [ ] Zero dollar amounts without proper tagging
- [ ] All percentages reference methodology 
- [ ] Investment estimates use qualitative scale (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] ROI projections use conservative language
- [ ] Timeline estimates include complexity justification
- [ ] Resource estimates tagged with scope basis

### Quality Gates:
1. **Automated Scan:** No "$" without "`[AI estimation`" tag
2. **Manual Review:** All quantitative claims have proper methodology
3. **Conservative Review:** Language emphasizes potential/estimated rather than guaranteed
4. **Source Check:** All claims traceable to problem analysis or clearly marked as estimates

## üìã SOLUTION SPACE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

### Agent 6 (Strategic Analysis):
- Focus on qualitative opportunity assessment
- Use Impact√óFeasibility-Risk scoring (transparent methodology)
- Avoid financial quantification unless directly derived from problem analysis

### Agent 7 (Process Optimization):  
- Emphasize process improvement potential
- Use efficiency language rather than cost language
- Base automation potential on technical assessment, not financial speculation

### Agent 8 (Communication):
- Maintain strategic value narrative
- Use investment/benefit language appropriate for audience
- Focus on competitive advantage and capability development over financial returns

## üö® ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

### If Violations Found:
1. **Immediate Fix:** Replace dollar amounts with qualitative language
2. **Add Estimation Tags:** All quantitative claims must have methodology
3. **Conservative Revision:** Emphasize potential rather than certainty
4. **Source Validation:** Ensure all claims traceable or properly tagged

### Prevention Measures:
- Pre-execution guardrail reminders for each agent
- Post-completion validation checklist
- Template updates with guardrail headers
- Conservative estimation methodology guides

This enforcement framework ensures solution space deliverables maintain strategic value while adhering to rigorous data integrity standards.
