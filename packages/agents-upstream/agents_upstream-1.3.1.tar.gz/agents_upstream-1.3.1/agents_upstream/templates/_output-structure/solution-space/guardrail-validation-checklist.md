# Solution Space Guardrail Validation Checklist

## Pre-Delivery Validation Requirements

### Financial/Investment Data ✅❌
- [ ] All dollar amounts have source attribution OR `[AI estimation]` tag
- [ ] ROI calculations reference source data or methodology
- [ ] Cost breakdowns explained with estimation basis
- [ ] No invented budget figures without clear derivation

### Time/Resource Estimates ✅❌
- [ ] Person-month estimates tagged as `[AI estimation based on X]`
- [ ] Timeline estimates reference complexity justification
- [ ] Resource requirements derived from scope analysis
- [ ] No arbitrary time allocations without basis

### Performance Projections ✅❌
- [ ] Efficiency improvements reference current state data
- [ ] Percentage improvements tagged with estimation method
- [ ] Success metrics derived from problem analysis
- [ ] No speculative performance claims

### Technology Assessments ✅❌
- [ ] Implementation complexity justified with technical reasoning
- [ ] Integration requirements reference existing systems
- [ ] Automation potential based on process analysis
- [ ] No invented technical specifications

### Compliance Verification ✅❌
- [ ] Every quantitative claim has proper attribution
- [ ] All assumptions clearly marked as `[Assumption: ...]`
- [ ] Source files properly referenced with `[Source: filename.md]`
- [ ] Conservative language used for uncertain estimates

## Red Flags to Avoid
⚠️ Specific dollar amounts without source
⚠️ Precise ROI percentages without calculation basis  
⚠️ Implementation timelines without complexity assessment
⚠️ Resource estimates without scope justification
⚠️ Performance improvements without baseline reference

## Acceptable Estimation Patterns
✅ "Strategic capacity increase of 40-50% `[AI estimation based on operational overhead reduction]`"
✅ "Implementation timeline: 8-10 weeks `[AI estimation based on standard API integration complexity]`"
✅ "Investment range: $X-Y `[AI estimation: conservative hourly rate × estimated effort]`"
✅ "Performance improvement potential `[Uncertain: requires validation through pilot implementation]`"
