# SFT Data Science Tool Kit

Welcome to the SFT Data Science Toolkit! This toolkit is designed to empower data scientists and analysts within SFT to efficiently analyse and derive insights from healthcare data.

## Installation

If trying to install this package locally (i.e. using DataSpell), open up a terminal and type:

`pip install -e  "PATH\TO\FOLDER"`

If this is successful, it's then as simple as using:

`import sfttoolbox`

as you would with any other package.

## Notebooks

Notebooks contain ideas for new tools with example useage. The more documentation for the intentional use and interface, the faster the code can be implemented in the module!
