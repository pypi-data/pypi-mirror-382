Simulation Example 2

This example demonstrates a simulation using a directed graph where patient movement is determined by probabilities,
and nodes have capacity constraints based on available staff for appointments.

In this example, each node represents a unit where patients can have appointments. The capacity of each node is determined
by the available staff and the duration of the appointments. For instance, if a node has staff available for 8 hours in a day,
and each appointment requires 1 hour, the node can handle up to 8 appointments per day.

To run this example, use the following command in the terminal:
    python _example2.py

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the `networkx` library.

Dependencies:
    - networkx

This example illustrates how to set up and execute a simulation that incorporates both probabilistic patient movement
and capacity constraints based on staff availability. It provides a more realistic scenario by considering resource
limitations in the healthcare system.
