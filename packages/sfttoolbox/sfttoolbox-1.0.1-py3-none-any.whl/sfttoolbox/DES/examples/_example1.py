Simulation Example 1

This example demonstrates a simple simulation using a directed graph where patient movement is determined by
probabilities. This example does not take node capacity into account.

To run this example, use the following command in the terminal:
    python _example1.py

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the `networkx` library.

Dependencies:
    - networkx

This example helps to illustrate the basic setup and execution of a simulation without capacity constraints, focusing
on probabilistic patient movement through the system.
