    # yarl support is planned but not ready, 
    # I would like for yarl to have a cimport for URL objects first before
    # I start using it with this project so that maximum performance can
    # be achieved and before that can happen 3 things must take place for 
    # that to be completed. 

    # 1. propcache which yarl utilizes needs to be cimportable,
    #   I have already wrote a pull request that would do that it 
    #   just needs the stamp of approval by another maintainer.
    # 2. multidict needs a CPython capsule, this should be avalible in 6.7
    # 3. yarl will need a cython branch not just for Quoting/UnQuoting but also 
    # for URL objects and an __init__.pxd file for importing with cython
