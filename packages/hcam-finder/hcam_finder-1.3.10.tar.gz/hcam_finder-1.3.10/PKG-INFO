Observation planning and finding charts for HiPERCAM, ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC

The ``hcam_finder`` package provides Python scripts ``hfinder``, ``ufinder`` and ``usfinder``
for observation planning with HiPERCAM on the WHT and GTC, ULTRACAM on the NTT and
ULTRASPEC on the TNT, respectively.

These tools allow you to generate finding charts as well as specify the instrument setup
you require, whilst providing an estimate of observing cadence, exposure time and
S/N estimates.

.. Note::

        Creating a finding chart and instrument setup for the above instruments are more
        tightly connected than is usually the case with CCD imagers. To avoid errors in
        phase II setups, you **must** use the tools above to generate finding charts. By 
        doing so, and reading the instrument-specific documentation below, you will avoid
        the non-optimal phase II setups that arise from a lack of awareness of the peculiarities
        of imagers designed for high time resolution.

``hcam_finder`` is written in Python and is based on TKinter. It should be compatible
with Python2 and Python3.

Installation
------------

The software is written as much as possible to make use of core Python
components. It requires my own `hcam_widgets <https://github.com/HiPERCAM/hcam_widgets>`_ module.
It also relies on the third party libraries `astropy <http://astropy.org/>`_ for astronomical
calculations and catalog lookup, as well as `ginga <https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for
image display. Optionally, you can also use `astroquery <https://astroquery.readthedocs.io>`_ to expand
the range of surveys one can download images from.

Installing using ``pip`` should take care of these dependencies. Simply install with::

 pip install hcam_finder

or if you don't have root access::

 sudo pip install hcam_finder

or::

 pip install --user hcam_finder
