### Introduction:
The module was developed for use at IPF Dresden as a tool to extract data via *RS485* from
Pfeiffer Vacuum Pumps using the *Pfeiffer Vacuum Protocol*.
The here published module was tested with Pfeiffer Vacuum Highscroll 6 Pumps.<p>
Before working with this software please refer to the documentation of the Pfeiffer Vacuum Protocoll in the manual of :
your device. For example the manual of the Pfeiffer Vacuum Highscroll Pumps:

- https://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/filepool/file/scroll-pumps/pu0095bde_d.pdf?referer=2573&detailPdoId=46287&request_locale=en_EN

An uptodate version of the module documented in this readme can be found at the following IPF GitLab repository:<p>
- https://gitlab.ipfdd.de/Henn/pypfeiffervacuumhighscrollprotocol

This repository is based on a GitHub repository by Christopeher M. Pirce 
(https://github.com/electronsandstuff/py-pfeiffer-vacuum-protocol)
If you encounter problems while using this software or have ideas for enhancing it, please feel free 
to contribute to this GitLab repository or get in contact with the auther at henn@ipfdd.de!

### Setup:

#### Connection:
For working with the software the Pfeiffer Vacuum Pump needs to be connected to the controlling computer with 
an adapter to a USB (or other Serial Interface). For this purpose adapters are available by Pfeiffer Vacuum themselves
(Pfeiffer Vacuum order number: PM 061 207 -T). It is also possible to build your one connection cabel, the pin diagram is 
documentated in the original manual (linked above) of the Highscroll 6 pumps.


Please ashure a working connection before using the module! 
A connection to the pump can be detected for example using the device manager and tested using CleverTerm / HyperTerm
or the pyserial libary.

#### Python:
To work with the module use Python 3.10 or newer. The module relies on the following packages that can be installed
using pip.

- enum
- pyserial (To use the Module you need to pass a serial object as parameter.)
  

Locate the pyPfeifferVacuumHighscrollProtocol.py file in the root folder of your python script.
Use the module as in the following:<p>

```
import serial
import logging
import pyPfeifferVacuumHighscrollProtocol as pvhp

ComPort = "COM1"
PumpAddress = 2

# defining serial objekt
ser = serial.Serial()
baudrate = 9200
ser.port = ComPort
ser.timeout = 1

try:
    # Open the serial port with a 1 second timeout
    ser.open()
    if ser.is_open:
        logging.info("serial connection established")
        print("serial connection established")

        # Read the pressure from address 2 and prin t it
        p = pvhp.read_pressure(ser, PumpAdress)
        print("Pressure: {:.3f} bar".format(p))

except Exception:
    logging.error("Error querying the Pfeiffer Vacuum pump!")
    print("Error Error querying the Pfeiffer Vacuum pump!")

```

The module has a build in filter for invalid characters written by C. Pirce. The use of the filter is dokumented 
in the pvp GitHub repository (https://github.com/electronsandstuff/py-pfeiffer-vacuum-protocol)
