### APB Read

### APB Bus

The `APBBus` is used to map to a APB interface on the `dut`.  Class methods `from_entity` and `from_prefix` are provided to facilitate signal default name matching.

#### Required:
* _psel_
* _pwrite_
* _paddr_
* _pwdata_
* _pready_
* _prdata_

#### Optional:
* _pstrb_
* _pprot_
* _pslverr_

### APB Master

The `ApbMaster` class implement a APB driver and is capable of generating read and write operations against APB slaves.

The master automatically handles data wider than the bus width by splitting transactions into multiple sequential APB accesses at consecutive addresses. This allows seamless transfers of wide data values across narrower APB interfaces.

To use these modules, import the one you need and connect it to the DUT:

    from cocotbext.apb import ApbMaster, ApbBus

    bus = ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "s_apb")
    apb_driver = ApbMaster(bus, dut.clk)

The first argument to the constructor accepts an `ApbBus` object.  These objects are containers for the interface signals and include class methods to automate connections.

Once the module is instantiated, read and write operations can be initiated in a couple of different ways.

#### `ApbMaster`constructor parameters
* _bus_: `ApbBus` object containing APB interface signals
* _clock_: clock signal
* _reset_: reset signal (optional)
* _reset_active_level_: reset active level (optional, default `True`)


#### Additional optional arguments for `ApbMaster`
* _seednum_: For random testing a seed can be supplied, default `None`, random seed.


#### Methods
* `enable_logging()`: Enable debug logging
* `disable_logging()`: Disable debug logging
* `enable_backpressure(seednum=None)`: Enable random delays on the interface
* `disable_backpressure()`: Disable random delays on the interface
* `wait()`: blocking wait until all outstanding operations complete
* `write(addr, data, strb=-1, prot=ApbProt.NONSECURE, error_expected=False, length=-1)`: write _data_ (bytes or int), to _addr_, wait for result.  If an slverr is experienced a critical warning will be issued by default, but will reduced this to an info warning if `error_expected=True`. If _data_ is wider than the bus width, it will automatically be split into multiple sequential APB write accesses at consecutive addresses. The optional _length_ parameter can override the automatic length calculation, should be a multiple of the number of bytes in the wdata bus.
* `write_nowait(addr, data, strb=-1, prot=ApbProt.NONSECURE, error_expected=False, length=-1)`: write _data_ (bytes or int), to _addr_, submit to queue. If an slverr is experienced a critical warning will be issued by default, but will reduced this to an info warning if `error_expected=True`. If _data_ is wider than the bus width, it will automatically be split into multiple sequential APB write accesses at consecutive addresses. The optional _length_ parameter can override the automatic length calculation, should be a multiple of the number of bytes in the wdata bus.
* `read(addr, data=bytes(), prot=ApbProt.NONSECURE, error_expected=False, length=-1)`: read bytes, at _addr_, if _data_ supplied check for match, wait for result. If an slverr is experienced a critical warning will be issued by default, but will reduced this to an info warning if `error_expected=True`. If _data_ is wider than the bus width, it will automatically be split into multiple sequential APB read accesses at consecutive addresses. The optional _length_ parameter can override the automatic length calculation, should be a multiple of the number of bytes in the wdata bus.
* `read_nowait(addr, data=bytes(), prot=ApbProt.NONSECURE, error_expected=False, length=-1)`: read bytes, at _addr_, if _data_ supplied check for match, submit to queue. If an slverr is experienced a critical warning will be issued by default, but will reduced this to an info warning if `error_expected=True`. If _data_ is wider than the bus width, it will automatically be split into multiple sequential APB read accesses at consecutive addresses. The optional _length_ parameter can override the automatic length calculation, should be a multiple of the number of bytes in the wdata bus.

### APB slave

The `ApbSlave` classe implement an APB slaves and is capable of completing read and write operations from upstream APB masters.  This modules can either be used to perform memory reads and writes on a `MemoryInterface` on behalf of the DUT, or they can be extended to implement customized functionality.

To use these modules, import the one you need and connect it to the DUT:

    from cocotbext.apb import ApbBus, ApbSlave, MemoryRegion

    apb_slave = ApbSlave(ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "m_apb"), dut.clk, dut.rst)
    region = MemoryRegion(2**apb_slave.read_if.address_width)
    apb_slave.target = region

The first argument to the constructor accepts an `ApbBus` object.  These objects are containers for the interface signals and include class methods to automate connections.

It is also possible to extend these modules; operation can be customized by overriding the internal `_read()` and `_write()` methods.  See `ApbRam` for an example.

#### `ApbSlave` constructor parameters

* _bus_: `ApbBus` object containing APB interface signals
* _clock_: clock signal
* _reset_: reset signal (optional)
* _reset_active_level_: reset active level (optional, default `True`)
* _target_: target region (optional, default `None`)

#### `ApbSlave` editable attibutes

It is possible to set area of addressable memory to be treated a priviledged address space or instruction address space.  If an APB master tries to access these regions, but has not set the correct `prot` value, `NONSECURE` for example, the `ApbSlave` will issue a `slverr` duting the `pready` phase of it response.

The `ApbSlave` has two attributes that can be edited by the user to allocate addresses and/or address ranges to the priviledged or instruction space.

* _privileged_addrs_
* _instruction_addrs_

Both attributes are arrays, and each element can be a single address, or a two element list, with a low address to a high address:

    tb.ram.privileged_addrs =  [[0x1000, 0x1fff], 0x3000]
    tb.ram.instruction_addrs = [[0x2000, 0x2fff], 0x4000]

If there is a read or a write with an address in this space, and the prot from the master does not match, it will report the type of error, as a warning, and assert `slverr`. The access will also be unsuccessful, the write will not occur and a read will result in all zeros being returned.

### APB RAM

The `ApbRam` class implements APB RAMs and is capable of completing read and write operations from upstream APB masters.  These modules are extensions of the corresponding `ApbSlave` module.  Internally, `SparseMemory` is used to support emulating very large memories.

To use these modules, import and connect it to the DUT:

    from cocotbext.apb import ApbBus, ApbRam

    apb_ram = ApbRam(ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "m_apb"), dut.clk, dut.rst, size=2**32)

The first argument to the constructor accepts an `ApbBus` object.  These objects are containers for the interface signals and include class methods to automate connections.

Once the module is instantiated, the memory contents can be accessed in a couple of different ways.  First, the `mmap` object can be accessed directly via the `mem` attribute.  Second, `read()`, `write()`, and various word-access wrappers are available.  Hex dump helper methods are also provided for debugging.  For example:

    apb_ram.write(0x0000, b'test')
    data = apb_ram.read(0x0000, 4)
    apb_ram.hexdump(0x0000, 4, prefix="RAM")

Multi-port memories can be constructed by passing the `mem` object of the first instance to the other instances.  For example, here is how to create a four-port RAM:

    apb_ram_p1 = ApbRam(ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "m00_apb"), dut.clk, dut.rst, size=2**32)
    apb_ram_p2 = ApbRam(ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "m01_apb"), dut.clk, dut.rst, mem=apb_ram_p1.mem)
    apb_ram_p3 = ApbRam(ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "m02_apb"), dut.clk, dut.rst, mem=apb_ram_p1.mem)
    apb_ram_p4 = ApbRam(ApbBus.from_prefix(dut, "m03_apb"), dut.clk, dut.rst, mem=apb_ram_p1.mem)

#### `ApbRam` and `ApbLiteRam` constructor parameters

* _bus_: `ApbBus` object containing APB interface signals
* _clock_: clock signal
* _reset_: reset signal (optional)
* _reset_active_level_: reset active level (optional, default `True`)
* _size_: memory size in bytes (optional, default `2**32`)
* _mem_: `mmap` or `SparseMemory` backing object to use (optional, overrides _size_)

* _mem_: directly access shared `mmap` or `SparseMemory` backing object
