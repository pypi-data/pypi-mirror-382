    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask for a distribution, not a sample.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the complete `verbalized-sampling` framework. Instead of asking an LLM for one answer, we ask it for a small **distribution**—`k` candidates with **weights**—then deterministically **filter → normalize → order**, and choose via **`dist.argmax()`** or **`dist.sample()`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll learn:\n",
    "1. **Quick Start** - One-liner usage with `verbalize()`\n",
    "2. **Core API** - `DiscreteDist`, `Item`, selection methods\n",
    "3. **Transforms** - `map()`, `filter_items()`, `reweight()`\n",
    "4. **Practical Recipes** - Creative writing, QA, synthetic data\n",
    "5. **Advanced Features** - Weight modes, serialization, metadata inspection"

    "# Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We've Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **One-Liner API**: `verbalize()` returns a `DiscreteDist` with ergonomic selection\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Deterministic Semantics**: Filter → Normalize → Order pipeline with full auditability\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Distribution-First Mental Model**: Work with distributions, not single samples\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Functional Transforms**: `map()`, `filter_items()`, `reweight()` preserve invariants\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Practical Recipes**: Creative writing, QA, synthetic data generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask for a distribution, not a sample** - Get `k` candidates with weights in one call\n",
    "2. **Weights are sampling masses** - Not calibrated probabilities; we normalize and expose repairs\n",
    "3. **Deterministic & auditable** - Stable ordering, recorded repairs, full trace metadata\n",
    "4. **Composable & safe** - Transforms preserve invariants (Σp=1, descending order)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`k`**: Number of candidates (breadth)\n",
    "- **`tau`**: Probability threshold for filtering (diversity knob)\n",
    "- **`temperature`**: LLM sampling temperature (orthogonal to VS)\n",
    "- **`weight_mode`**: How to normalize (`elicited`, `uniform`, `softmax`)\n",
    "- **`seed`**: For reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Verbalized Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ **Creative tasks** - Story openings, product names, brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ **Open-ended QA** - Multiple valid answers, coverage metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ **Synthetic data** - Generate diverse training examples with weights\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ **Bias mitigation** - Use `weight_mode=\"uniform\"` to equalize probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ **Exploration** - Sample from the distribution's \"tails\" for novelty\n",
