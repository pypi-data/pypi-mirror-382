Willow gazed across the silent meadow, where wildflowers nodded and bees hummed. The world seemed peaceful, held in the gentle embrace of morning. Finished, she licked her paws clean and ambled back towards the forest, the shadows cool and inviting. Safe and content, Willow disappeared beneath the ancient pines, carrying with her the quiet magic of a new day.</div></td><td style='vertical-align:top; padding:10px;'><strong>Story 4:</strong><br><div style='font-family: serif; line-height: 1.4;'>Deep within tangled undergrowth, a bear named Bristle tripped over a fallen branch. He grumbled, shaking out burs from his fur. Curiosity won; he returned to the strange stick and sniffed it. Ahead, a family of rabbits trembled, thinking Bristle must be angry. But Bristle only wanted to play. He batted the branch and rolled onto his back, sunlight dappling his belly. Laughter rippled through the clearing as the rabbits joined him, tossing leaves and twigs with abandon. From that day, Bristle became a legend—not for ferocity, but for teaching the woods that mighty hearts can hold gentle games.</div></td></tr><tr><td style='vertical-align:top; padding:10px;'><strong>Story 5:</strong><br><div style='font-family: serif; line-height: 1.4;'>In the quiet dawn, a bear ambled through the dew-kissed forest, nose twitching with curiosity. Every morning, Old Bramble checked the same trail, hoping for surprises. Today, wild raspberries glistened under a thorny bush. He settled back on his haunches, savoring berries, their tart juice staining his muzzle crimson. A distant woodpecker drummed a gentle rhythm. Suddenly, a butterfly landed on Bramble’s nose. He blinked, cross-eyed, then sneezed, sending it fluttering skyward like a tiny, sunlit miracle. Satisfied and sticky-faced, Bramble lumbered on, leaving behind only paw prints and the sweet memory of morning for the waking forest.</div></td><td style='vertical-align:top; padding:10px;'><strong>Story 5:</strong><br><div style='font-family: serif; line-height: 1.4;'>The city had never seen a bear, until one stormy dawn when a shaggy visitor wandered through the empty avenues. Streetlights flickered on fur slick with rain. No one dared approach as the bear paused at a corner bakery, nose quivering. The scent of fresh bread drew him, so he pressed a heavy paw against the cool glass. The baker, watching, placed two round loaves outside, heart pounding. The bear gently picked up the bread and shuffled toward the park. By sunrise, all that remained were paw prints and crumbs—enough for the city to wonder if kindness fed wild dreams.</div></td></tr></table>"]},"metadata":{}}],"source":["display_story_comparison(direct_responses, vs_stories, \"Story Generation Comparison\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rEf4Mm5A5IoS"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","# Key Benefits of Verbalized Sampling\n","\n","📣 **A simple training-free prompt** to mitigate mode collapse\n","\n","🎯 **Tunable Diversity**: Explores the \"tails\" of the distribution for tunable creativity.\n","\n","📈 **Scales with Model Size**: Verbalized Sampling works even better on larger models without sacrificing quality.\n","\n","✨ **Various Applications**: Effective for creative writing, social simulation, tweet and blog ideas, brainstorming, lesson plan ideas, etc.\n","\n","### 💡 Practical tips for using VS\n","- **Use large or reasoning models**: Works best with models like GPT-5, Claude-4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.\n","- **Ask for longer outputs if length matters**: The LLM may shorten the final output since it's generated in a single response.
