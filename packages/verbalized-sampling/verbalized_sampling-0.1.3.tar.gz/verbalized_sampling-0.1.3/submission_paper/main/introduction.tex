% RLHF has become a standard practice to ensure alignment with human preferences. However, it introduces \emph{mode collapse}—a significant reduction in output diversity, an unintended consequence: a significant reduction in output diversity~\citep{padmakumar_does_2024,lu2025aihumanityssalieriquantifying,west2025basemodelsbeataligned}.
% This phenomenon, known as \emph{mode collapse} \citep{janus2022modecollapse,omahony2024attributing,kirk2024understandingeffectsrlhfllm}, causes aligned  models to 
% % generate safe but near-duplicate responses (the ``mode'')
% favor a narrow set of responses (the ``mode'') over all plausible outputs.

Post-training alignment methods like RLHF %a standard alignment method,
can unintentionally cause \emph{mode collapse} \citep{janus2022modecollapse,omahony2024attributing,kirk2024understandingeffectsrlhfllm}, whereby the model favors a narrow set of responses (the ``mode'') over all plausible outputs, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_teaser}. This significantly reduces output diversity~\citep{padmakumar_does_2024,west2025basemodelsbeataligned}
%by making the model favor a narrow set of "mode" responses, sacrificing creativity and variety.

% For instance, it is inadequate to rely on a single reward model to capture diverse human preferences \cite{chakraborty2024maxmin} \citep{xiao2024algorithmic} and the KL-regularized optimization used in RLHF tends to amplify common, majority-style responses.
Existing work often attributes mode collapse to algorithmic causes such as inadequate reward models \citep{chakraborty2024maxmin} or the majority-favoring optimization process \citep{xiao2024algorithmic}. {In this paper, we show that the issue is more fundamental: mode collapse is an inherent property of preference data itself}.  We identify \emph{typicality bias}, the human tendency to prefer more typical text, as a pervasive data-level cause for mode collapse. Critically, this means that even with a perfect reward model and optimization process, inherent bias within preference datasets may still drive mode collapse, affecting the majority of alignment methods that rely on reward models. In Section~\ref{sec:typicality}, we formalize this concept with an analytical model, corroborated by empirical verification on preference datasets, to confirm the central role of typicality bias.
% We formalize an analytical model for how this cognitive bias can impact data during post-training (corroborated by empirical verifications on multiple preference datasets) and use our analysis to confirm the role of typicality bias in causing mode collapse.
% show that mode collapse is an inherent, pervasive property of the data, rather than an algorithmic bias that can be patched during training, even if we can design perfect reward models and perfectly maximized the reward, due to the inherent typicality bias in the data, we will still have mode collapse. 



%The issue is compounded by practices that occur even before RLHF: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) narrows the model's vocabulary \citep{li2024entropic}, and rigid chat templates further restrict its creativity \citep{yun2025price}. 
% So, we propose a thought experiment based on our theoretical findings: “what if we had access to a model that perfectly maximized the reward, would still have mode collapse because of the inherence data bias. %I think the other thing here to emphasize the novelty of our work is to pitch the mode collapsed oracle itself as a contribution -- it's really a new way to think about RLHF tuned LLMs and how to prompt them. VS is one algorithm that we recover from the thought experiment, because our focus is diversity, but it's great empirical success suggests this may be an improved direction of thought for LLM prompting aimed at other objectives.


% traces RLHF-driven mode collapse to KL-regularized optimization that amplifies majority modes \ciicatep{xiao2024algorithmic} and to the inadequacy of single-reward modeling under heterogeneous preferences \citep{chakraborty2024maxmin}, while pre-RLHF choices—cross-entropy SFT that narrows token distributions \citep{li2024entropic} and rigid chat templating \citep{yun2025price}—further compress diversity. 
% Our work builds on these existing studies by identifying a pervasive data bias (i.e., \textit{typlity}) that compounds existing algorithmic causes of mode collapse in RLHF. Moreover, we build on this theoretical contribution with practical, inference-time prompting approach, \emph{\ours}, to recover the model's output diversity.


%While these approaches can increase diversity, 
% But these methods often require substantial computational resources, extra care during inference time, or only work on open-source models. 
% Furthermore, training-based methods may undermines the safety benefits achieved by alignment~\citep{qi2024safetyalignmentjusttokens}, and decoding strategies often fail to fully address alignment-induced mode collapse~\citep{yang_how_2025}.
% Prompting-based techniques have emerged as a lightweight alternative~\citep{SummersStay2023BrainstormTS, mehrotra2024enhancingcreativitylargelanguage, wong2024simplestratdiversifyinglanguagemodel, tian2025macgyverlargelanguagemodels}, but many require manual, handcrafted prompts that can be overly prescriptive and complex.

% To this end, we first theoretically prove that proves RLHF indeed induces mode collapse by concentrating probability mass on a narrow set of  outputs (the mode). Inspired by the insights from the proof, we also propose a simple yet principled prompting strategy to mitigate mode collapse: we prompt the model to generate multiple candidate responses in a single pass and explicitly verbalize their corresponding probabilities,  as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_teaser}. We call this method \textbf{\textit{\ours}} (VS). In this way, we reformulate formulating the same prompt that asks for one instance, to a distributional query that asks for a distribution.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_teaser},  instead of a traditional, direct prompt asking for a single instance (e.g., ``tell me a joke about coffee''), we reformulate the prompt to explicitly ask the model to \emph{verbalize} a distribution of responses with corresponding probabilities (e.g., ``generate 5 responses with their probabilities''). We call our method \textbf{\textit{\ours} \textit{(VS)}}. 
Intuitively, VS works because different prompts collapse to different modes. The modal response to a traditional instance-level prompt tends towards stereotypicality. By contrast, when prompted for a distribution in VS, the modal response tends to approximate the distribution learned during pretraining, recovering the diversity of the underlying base model. Figure~\ref{fig:actual_vs_prompt} shows a ready-to-use VS prompt.

    \item \textbf{Empirical Gains.} We perform comprehensive experiments that show VS significantly improves the diversity-quality trade-off across tasks and model families, without compromising factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS boosts diversity by 1.6-2.1$\times$ over direct prompting (Figure~\ref{fig:creativity_main}), improves human evaluation scores by 25.7\% (Table~\ref{tab:human_study_diversity}), and recovers 66.8\% of the base model's diversity (Figure~\ref{fig:training_progression}). %VS further enables diversity tuning. 
    We also observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. These results open up possibilities in real-world tasks such as richer exploration in RL, hypothesis generation,  social simulation, and so on.
    \item \textbf{Broader Implications for Alignment.} Our work shows that mode collapse can be mitigated at inference time, aligned models retain significant inherent diversity, and the quality-diversity trade-off can be systematically improved through prompting alone.

    \caption{Qualitative and quantitative examples on different tasks. For \textbf{story writing}, VS improves the output diversity. For the \textbf{donation dialogue simulation} task, VS simulates a donation amount distribution much  closer to the human distribution, and generates more realistic persuasion behaviors (e.g., resistances and change of minds, see Table~\ref{tab:example_simulated_dialogue}). On the task of \textbf{enumerative open-ended QA}, we ask the model to ``\textit{generate US states}''. We first query a pretraining corpus (RedPajama) to establish a ``reference'' distribution of US state names in the pretraining data. The verbalized probability distribution generated by VS, when averaged over 10 trials, closely aligns with this reference pretraining distribution (KL=0.12). In contrast, direct prompting collapses into a few modes, repeatedly outputting states like California and Texas. See~\S\ref{appendix:probing_pre_training_data} for more detail. %\wyshi{See tablexx for more qualitative examples.}

% \paragraph{Our main contributions are as follows:}
% \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=20pt,labelsep=1em]
% \item \textbf{Enhanced creativity without quality trade-offs} (\S\ref{sec:creative_writing}): We demonstrate that \ourslower significantly improves diversity in creative writing tasks while maintaining comparable quality scores.
% \item \textbf{Improved dialogue simulation} (\S\ref{sec:dialogue_simulation_task}): \ourslower enables more realistic and diverse human behavior modeling in conversational scenarios, capturing the multifaceted nature of human responses.
% \item \textbf{Effective bias mitigation} (\S\ref{sec:bias_mitigation}): Our method reduces demographic bias in language generation by encouraging exploration of diverse perspectives and reducing mode collapse toward stereotypical responses.
% \item \textbf{Preserved truthfulness} (\S\ref{sec:commonsense}): Unlike many diversity-enhancing techniques, our approach maintains factual accuracy in commonsense reasoning tasks, showing that diversity gains do not compromise model reliability.
