    """
    Draws a bar plot comparing the response distributions for direct and verbalized sampling,
    using the same color and style for both bars, and adds coverage n as a legend entry
    similar to the KL divergence box in the reference code.

    This version plots counts (not probabilities) on the y-axis.
