Generate a grade school math word problem that involves a sequence of basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
        A bright middle school student should be able to solve the problem. The difficulty of the problem should be similar to typical middle school math problems.
        
        For the problem:
        - Specify the question.
        - Then provide a brief reasoning and the numerical answer.
        - The answer should be given after four hash marks (####) at the end of the reasoning. The answer should be a number.

        Format the generated problem as follows:
        Question: [question]
        Answer: [reasoning and answer, ending with #### [numerical answer]]

        Only include the question and answer in your response, and always begin your response with the question.
