If you are viewing this file over the Internet at
https://github.com/kcarlton55/bomcheck, and you wish to run this program
from there, click on the link icon that is located at the bottom of the 
file named README.md.  This will open up a live session over the Internet.
The file that will open is named bomcheck.ipyb.

Load into this folder the Excel files that contain the BOMs that you wish to 
compare.  When bomcheck.ipyb is open, you'll see a menu on the upper left.  
Go to the menu item named “Run”, and then pick “Run All Cells”.  After a few
seconds you will see the results of your BOM check.

The folder named exampledata has some sample data you can use.

To see arguments that can be applied to the bomcheck function, after the
program has been run, click Shift-Tab next to the call for the bomcheck
function.

Note that when you move and copy files around, the changes that you make are 
temporary, so don't worry about messing things up; After you shut down the
web site, files and folders will be reset to their original state.
