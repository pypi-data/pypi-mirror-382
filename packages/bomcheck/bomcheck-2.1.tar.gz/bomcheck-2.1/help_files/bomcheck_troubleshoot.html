        <p id="swnotprocessed"><b>1. CAD BOM not processed.</b> A CAD BOM I
            submitted wasn't compared to an ERP BOM. The only thing that happend is
            that the BOM was transformed to look like a BOM from ERP. What happened?
            Answer: No ERP BOM was found to compare it to the CAD BOM.</p>

        <p id="swnotprocessed2"><b>2. Assembly pn in ERP, but CAD BOM not
            processed.</b> I have a particular assembly/subassembly BOM entered into
            ERP but the bomcheck program reports that that it cannot find the BOM.
            Why? For that particular assembly, the parts of that assembly have not
            been entered yet into ERP.</p>

        <p id="slnotprocessed"><b>3. ERP BOM not processed.</b> An ERP BOM was
            submitted but nothing happened to indicate that the BOM had even been looked
            at. What happened? Answer: bomcheck ignores all BOMs from ERP for which
            it can't find a CAD BOM to compare it to.</p>

        <p id="iqdu"><b>4. Empty I Q D U fields (e.g. "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"  and not "‒‒‒X‒" or "‒‒‒‒" as should be).</b>
            The I, Q, D, and U values that indicate pass/fail results are shown empty
            If this is not the case then it indicates that a part number is
            repeated in the ERP BOM.  Duplicate part numbers should not be in an ERP BOM!</p>

        <p id="length"><b>5. SW's lengths not converted to FT.</b> A part length in CAD
            did not convert of feet in order to compare to a length in ERP. Why not?
            If in the CAD check you see that the unit of measure for length is EA when it
            should be FT, it means that the length column is not shown on the CAD BOM.</p>

        <p id="accuracy"><b>6. What accuracy should lengths be?</b> If you are running
            the bomcheckgui program, at <i>File > Settings</i> the decimal place accuracy
            is set for rounding bomcheck lengths (e.g. .83 ft).  An accuracy of 2 (for feet)
            is a good number. This means that if two places are shown, then the length is
            accurate to within &#177;0.06 inches.  This is close enough. Then if the lengths
            shown in CAD and ERP differ by more than &#177;0.06 inches, then
            bomcheck will flag this as an error. Of course, a greater level of accuracy can be
            set.</p>

        <p id="no_UM"><b>7. U/M (unit of measure) missing for part shown in ERP BOM.</b>
           Someone forgot to enter the U/M into ERP.
        </p>

        <p id="UM"><b>8. A U/M value did not convert properly.</b>
           In the LENGTH column I put <i>56 SQ. IN.</i>, Bomcheck should convert
           it to square feet.  Right?  Yes, it should, but <i>SQ. IN.</i> is
           not a unit of measure that bomcheck will recognize.  To see units of measure
           that will be recognized, see <i>Units of Measure</i> in bomcheck's
           help section 1.
        </p>

        <p id="crash_cols"><b>9. Program crashed due to missing columns.</b> Bomcheck crashed complaining
            of missing columns. What went wrong? Answer: several things could have happened.
            An ERP BOM may have been mistakenly labeled as as CAD BOM (i.e., had
            _sw.xlsx extension). A CAD BOM may have been labeled as an ERP BOM
            (i.e., had a _sl.xlsx extension). In short, the arrangement of the BOM in the
            Excel sheet is not correct.</p>

        <p id="config_txt"><b>10. Unable to open config.txt (bomcheckgui only)</b>
            The program reports that it cannot open up a file named config.txt. What is that
            about? Answer: Whenever a user makes a settings change (File > Settings),
            bomcheckgui remembers those settings for future use by saving those settings in a
            file named config.txt. That file is located in a user's settings folder. The file is at
            <i>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\bomcheck\config.txt</i>.
            (The bomcheckgui program automatically creates this file.) Perhaps user
            rights were somehow severed??? Contact the IT manager for help.</p>

        <p id="wrong_descrip"><b>11. Pn's description in CAD BOM changed after program ran.</b>
            You have two or more parts or part configurations that are configured
            to show the same part number on a CAD BOM.  As an example, two hoses
            with different bends, but with same length and same end fittings
            should report the same part number on a CAD BOM.  But the two hoses
            come from two different CAD solid model files or configurations.
            The two models/configs should, obviously, have the same descriptions
            assigned.  But you may have mistakenly put in different descriptions.
            When the bomcheck program is run, it combines quantities of hoses
            and picks one of the two descriptions to compare to the ERP
            description. Bomcheck could pick the part with the wrong description.
            Bomcheck does not check to see if descriptions are different between
            models or configurations.   That is up to you to catch and correct.</p>

          <p id="no_sync"><b>12. CAD BOM and ERP BOM seem to not sync at all.</b>
            When you pulled a multilevel BOM from the ERP, you may have mistakenly
            pushed the sort button on the LEVEL column or some other column
            within the ERP's BOM.  The button to sort and to extract an Excel
            file are close together and you mistakenly pushed the sort.
            Close the ERP BOM and derive the BOM again.  Yet another posible
            reason that things are not working out is that you misnamed a _sw.xlsx
            file to a _sl.xlsx file, or vice-versa.
          </p>

          <p id="obsolete"><b>13. PN is in both the ERP BOM and the CAD BOM,
            but doesn't appear in bomcheck results???</b>
            I have a part no. in the CAD BOM, and I have the same PN in the ERP (overview)
            BOM, but when I run bomcheck, the PN doesn't appear on the ERP's
            side of the results.&nbsp;  So why in my PN not showing? &nbsp; In the ERP overview BOM,
            look for the column named <i>Obsolete Date</i>.&nbsp;  If there is any
            text in that column for a PN, then bomcheck will not use that PN
            when it runs.&nbsp;  To use that PN in your evaluation, erase any text in
            that column for that particular PN.
          </p>
          <p> Note: The obsolete column along with entries thereof is never
            shown in a multilevel BOM</p.
