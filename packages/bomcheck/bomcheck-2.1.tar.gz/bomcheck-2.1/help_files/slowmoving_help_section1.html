    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Parts nos. from slow moving inventory can be compared with part nos. of your
	  current project in order to look for possible substitutions of parts in order to
	  use up inventory.&nbsp;  File names of BOMs form SolidWorks and SyteLine end with
      _sw.csv and _sl.xlsx respectively.&nbsp;  By adding a third file to the mix ending
      with _sm.xlsx, which contains a BOM of slow moving parts, the comparison can be
      made by clicking the 2nd run button on the menu bar, i.e, the green triangle icon. 	  

      
    <h2 id="obtaining">Obtaining a slow moving (SM) BOM</h2>
    <p>Go to 
      <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	  https://app.powerbi.com/</a>, then click PC Indiana Dashboards > Inventory
	  (on the left side menu) > Inventory Forecast.&nbsp;  This will lead to a page that looks like
	  this: <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
      <img src="inventory_forecast.png" alt="inventory forecast pic" width=900></div>
	  
	<p>At the upper right is the "View" drop down menu.&nbsp;   From that pick "Actual size".
	  (If you don't resize to "Actual size", then the "More options" menu is difficult
      to access.)&nbsp; Now go to the "More options" menu (the three dots, ...).   
      and choose "Export data" and "Data with current layout".&nbsp;  Name the
      file anything you want, except the end of the file name must end with "_sm.xlsx",
      for example <i>slowmoving_sm.xlsx</i>.</p>
      
    <p>To use this file, drag and drop it into the bomcheck program the same way
      that you drag and drop _sw.xlsx and _sl.xlsx files.</p>
       
       
    <h2 id="menu">Slow moving's menu options</h2>
      <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
      <img src="bomcheck_s_look.png" alt="bomcheck menu options pic" width=900></div>
	
	<p> You'll notice on the top menu bar a number of icons and buttons.  These are:</p>
	
	<ol>
      <li><b>Run bomcheck button:</b>&nbsp; This button runs the bomcheck program.
          (Does not access the _sm BOM.)  It compares sm to sl BOMs.</li>
	  <li><b>Run comparator button:</b>&nbsp; The button runs the comparator in order to compare
          _sw and/or_sl BOMs to parts with in the _sm BOM</li>
	  <li><b>The "clear", X, button:</b>&nbsp; Delete all entries from bomcheck's drag/drop list so 
	      that you can repopulate it with other files that you want to examine.</li>
	  <li><b>folder button:</b>&nbsp; Open the last folder you used from which you dragged files from. </li>
	  <li><b>filter: </b> This is a mask by which you can select what part nos. the comparator compares.
          &nbsp;This filter is examined in more detail on page two.</li>
	  <li><b>% similarity: </b>&nbsp; When the comparator is run, you'll see a column named "similar" in the results.
	      The number there indicates the similarity of the text from the sw/sl descriptions to those
		  of the pn descriptions from the sm BOM.&nbsp;  This similarity does not guarantee that the sm 
		  part can replace a part from the sw/sl BOM, but rather allows the user to examine
		  those parts first since they are more likely to be a candidates for alternate parts.&nbsp;  You can enter a number
		  in this field to mask out lesser scoring parts.&nbsp;  For example, if you enter 
		  50, then only scores of 50% and above will show in the results.</li>
	  <li><b>age: </b>&nbsp; In the comparator's results is a column named "age".  This is how long ago
	      it's been since that part was last used (days).&nbsp;  If for example 60 is entered, then only parts that
		  have been sitting on the shelf for more that 60 days will be shown.</li>
	  <li><b>switches: </b>&nbsp; Check boxes by which you can filter results even more:
          <ol>
		      <li><b><i>Include "Demand" pns.</b></i>&nbsp;The default is to filter out parts where there is a Demand for those parts.</li>   
			  <li><b><i>Include "On Hand" pns.</b></i>&nbsp;The default is to filter out "Qty On Hand" parts that are zero.</li>
			  <li><b><i>Do not show pns listed in the drop list. </b></i>&nbsp;Do not show sw/sl/sm parts that are in the drop list (list is shown in "settings").</li>
		  </ol>
	  </li>
 	</ol>
	
	<p><i>Note: Whenever you hover your mouse over any of these buttons, you'll see a description
	of the button at the bottom of the main window.</i></p>
	
	
	<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
	   <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
	   <img src="settings.png" alt="settings pic" width=450></div>
	   
	<p>If you go to File > Settings, you will find a "drop list" and an
	  "exceptions list".&nbsp; Any part number in the drop list will not appear in
	  results of the comparison of slow moving parts.&nbsp;  In the example above, any
	  part nos. that begin with 10, 24, 25, etc. will not be shown.&nbsp;  These numbers
	  are pump, paint, stickers, etc. part numbers.&nbsp;  Exceptions to the list
	  are in the exceptions list.&nbsp;  For example, 2672 is for VFD electrical 
	  components.</p>
	  
	<h2 id="output">Sample output</h2>
	   <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
	   <img src="slowmoving_output.png" alt="sample of output pic" width=900></div>	  
	   
	<p>The first three columns, i.e. pn sw/sl, desrip sw/sl, and cost_, come from the
	  SolidWorks and/or SyteLine data that you entered (_sw.csv and _sl_.xlsx files).&nbsp;
	  The remainder of the columns are a result of the comparison of the sw/sl
	  BOMs to the sm BOM.</p>
	  
	<p>Blank cells in the first three columns means that the first non-blank
	  cell above that blank cell has the same value as the non-blank cell.&nbsp;  That is,
	  the cells that are blank were made that way in order to remove clutter.</p>   
	  
	
	<h2 id="export">Export results to Excel</h2>
	<p>Always export results to Excel.&nbsp;  Place the file in the Engineering folder of
	  the CO (Teams: VIN UWF US - PCI Sys Fldrs > Documents).&nbsp;  The end of the
	  file name should be <i>_alts.xlsx.</i>&nbsp;  For example: <i>alternativePts_alts.xlsx</i>.&nbsp;
	  The last column of that file will have a column named "alt qty".&nbsp;  In
	  that column at the appropriate row enter the number of alternate parts that will be used.</p>
