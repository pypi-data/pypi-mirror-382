        <p id="csv_ok"><b>1. CSV OK?</b> SyteLine sometimes default's to exporting to a CSV (.csv)
            format instead of to an Excel (.xlsx) format. Can a CSV file be used? Yes,
            however the Excel format is more reliable. Use that.</p>

        <p id="csv_2_excel"><b>2. CSV to Excel compare?</b> Can an Excel BOM (.xlsx) be compared to a CSV (.csv) BOM?
            Yes</p>

        <p id="csv_crash"><b>3. Using CSV causes program to crash.</b> The program crashed when when I
            tried using a CSV format. What can I do? As stated esrlier, use the .xlsx format
            instead. Character encoding in CSV files can differ depending on the program that
            generated the CSV file... even if the extension is <i>.csv</i>. The character encoding
            cannot be seen by human eyes by opening up and looking at the CSV file.
            Bomcheck sometimes can't correctly interpret the various forms of encoding.</p>

        <p id="multilevel"><b>4. Multilevel BOMs. </b> SolidWorks BOMs are sometimes multilevel (subassemblies
            within the main assembly), and the BOMs from SyteLine can be also. Can
            bomcheck handle these? Yes. In fact, a subassembly in a subassembly in a
            subassembly, and so forth, can exist. Bomcheck handles any level of
            subassemblies.</p>

        <p>For a multilevel SolidWorks BOM to work, the Item numbers in the BOM
            must be numbered to indicate the level; e.g. 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2,
            3.2.2.1, 3.2.2.2, 3.3 and so forth. For a multilevel SyteLine BOM to work,
            the BOM must have a column titled <i>Level</i> with values in that column looking
            like 0, 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc. These formats are standard for
            SolidWorks and Syteline.</p>

        <p id="swnotprocessed"><b>5. SolidWorks BOM not processed.</b> A SolidWorks BOM I submitted wasn't
            compared to a SyteLine BOM. The only thing that happend is that the BOM was
            transformed to look like a BOM from SyteLine. What happened? Answer: no
            SyteLine BOM was found to compare it to the SolidWorks BOM.</p>

        <p id="swnotprocessed2"><b>6. Assembly pn in Syteline, but SolidWorks BOM not processed.</b> I
            have a particular assembly/subassembly BOM entered into
            SyteLine but the bomcheck program reports that that it cannot find the BOM.
            Why? For that particular assembly, the parts of that assembly have not
            been entered yet into SyteLine.</p>

        <p id="slnotprocessed"><b>7. SyteLine BOM not processed.</b> A SyteLine BOM was submitted but
            nothing happened to indicate that the BOM had even been looked at. What
            happened? Answer: bomcheck ignores all BOMs from SyteLine for which it can't
            find a SolidWorks BOM to compare it to.</p>

        <p id="iqdu"><b>8. Empty i q d u fields.</b> The i, q, d, and u values that indicate
            pass/fail results are shown empty (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) for a particular
            part number. Aren't dashes and/or Xs (---- or --X-, etc.) supposed to be shown?
            Yes, there should be a dashes or Xs in the i, q, d, u fields. These fields
            being empty indicates that a part number is repeated in the SyteLine BOM.
            Duplicate part numbers should not be in a SyteLine BOM.</p>

        <p id="length"><b>9. SW's lengths not converted to FT.</b> A part length in SolidWorks
            did not convert of feet in order to compare to a length in SyteLine. Why not?
            In the bom check you'll see that the unit of measure for length from SolidWorks
            is EA when it should be FT. This means that the length column is not shown on
            the SolidWorks BOM as it should be.</p>

        <p id="crash_cols"><b>10. Crash... missing columns.</b> Bomcheck crashed complaining of
            missing columns. What went wrong? Answer: several things could have happened.
            A SyteLine BOM may have been mistakenly labeled as as SolidWorks BOM (had _sw.xlsx
            extension). A SolidWorks BOM may have been labeled as a SyteLine BOM (had
            a _sl.xlsx extension). The column names for a SolidWorks BOM may not be on
            the second row of the SW Excel sheet (Dekker's SW BOMs has the assembly
            part number on the the first row). The column names for a SyteLine BOM
            are not on the first row. In short, the arrangement of the BOM in the
            Excel sheet is not in it's normal arrangement.</p>

        <p id="config_txt"><b>11. Unable to open config.txt (bomcheckgui only)</b> 
            The program reports that it cannot open up a file named config.txt. What is that
            about? Answer: Whenever a user makes a settings change (File > Settings), 
            bomcheckgui remembers those settings for future use by saving those settings in a
            file named config.txt. In that file is also saved the last accessed folder 
            containing BOMs. That file is located in a user's settings folder. The file is at
            <i>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\bomcheck\config.txt</i>.
            (The bomcheckgui program automatically creates this file.) Perhaps user
            rights were somehow severed??? Contact the IT manager for help.</p>

        <p id="accuracy"><b>13. What accuracy should lengths be?</b> At <i>File > Settings</i>
            the decimal place accuracy is set for rounding bomcheck lengths (e.g. .83 ft).
            An accuracy of 2 is a good number. This means that if two places are shown, then
            the length is accurate to within &#177;0.06 inches.  This is close enough. Then 
            if the lengths shown in SolidWorks and SyteLine differ by more than &#177;0.06 
            inches, then bomcheck will flag this as an error. Of course, a greater level of
            accuracy can be set.</p>
