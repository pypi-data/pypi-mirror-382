# This file allows you to make bomcheck recognize different names for
# column headings in BOMs, different units of measure, etc.

# Remove the leading comment character, i.e. the pound symbol, #,  that
# precedes the setting that you wish to activate.  For any setting not
# activated, the bomcheck program will use its own internal default value.
#
# Follow the format in the examples below.  That is, use brackets,
# quotation marks, and commas in the same manner shown in the examples.

# In a SolidWorks BOM, do not do any length conversions for these part

# SyteLine can have a column named "Obsolete Date".  In that column are shown
# dates for when part numbers stopped being used in a BOM.  If the bomcheck
# program finds this column, and finds a date corresponding to a particular
# part number, then this part number will be discarded from the bom check.

#obs = ["Obsolete Date", "Obsolete"]


# ########### USED ONLY WHEN BOMCHECKGUI IS NOT BEING USED #################
# The unit of measure of lengths from a SolidWorks BOM are understood to be
# inches unless a unit of measure is afixed to a length (e.g. 507mm).  Valid
# units of measure: inch, feet, yard, millimenter, centimeter, meter. (Single
# value only):

#from_um = "inch"


# ########### USED ONLY WHEN BOMCHECKGUI IS NOT BEING USED #################
# If no matching item is found in a SyteLine BOM for a given item in a SW BOM,
# then convert to this U/M.  Otherwise convert to the U/M given in the SL BOM
# measure.  (Single value only):

#to_um = "feet"


# If an area of an item is specified in the SW length column, e.g. 13.5 sqmm,
# then during program execution convert to this U/M just prior to comparing
# the SW BOM to that in SyteLine.  Otherwise if the item is found in the ERP
# (SyteLine) BOM, this U/M will be ignored and will be converted to the U/M in
# the ERP.  (Single value only.):

#toA_um = "SQI"


# If a liguid volume of an item is specified in the length column, e.g. 4.5 pt,
# convert to this U/M.  If the item is found in the ERP (SyteLine) BOM, it will
# be converted to that U/M; this U/M will be ignored.  (Single value only.):

#toL_um = "GAL"


# When a BOM is extracted from the CAD program, Microsoft Excel annoyingly at
# times adds whitespace characters within a part number.  This results when
# Excel tries to cram a lenthy part no. within too narrow a cell.  The number
# is split into multiple rows within the cell.  The splits are  interpreted
# as whitespaces by bomcheck.  The part no. then is not recognized correctly.
# Set the below variable to true if you want bomcheck to delete this
# whitespace; false if your company has whitespace characters within their
# part numbers. (lower case only true or false only)

#del_whitespace = true


# Column header names of bom check results have names like assy, Item, iqdu,
# etc.  These names can be changed.  For example, you can change iqdu to IQDU,
# and Description to Descripci√≥n.

#assy = "assy"
#Item = "Item"
#iqdu = "iqdu"
#Q = "Q"
#Description = "Description"
#U = "U"


# SyteLine BOMs have columns named Op (Operation), and WC (Work Center) for
# what occurs for a particular operation.  These values are placed in a
# SolidWorks BOM just prior to it being comparted to a SyteLine BOM.  For
# the most part, you can ignore doing anything with these variables.

#Op = "Op"
#OpValue = "10"
#WC = "WC"
