Get Help Using the CLI
----------------------

The ``--help`` flag provides additional documentation and tips. You can add it to the end of any of the available commands for more information.

For example, to learn what commands are available for this tool, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   vcp --help


You can also get help with learning how to use individual commands by adding it to a command, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   vcp data describe --help

New commands will be added in the future that will support working with the Virtual Cells Platform's `Model <https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/models>`_ and `Dataset <https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/datasets>`_ entities.
