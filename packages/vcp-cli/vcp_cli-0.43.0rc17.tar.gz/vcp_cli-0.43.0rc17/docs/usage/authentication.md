# Authentication

Some CLI commands will require that you have a user account on the Virtual
Cell Models (Virtual Cells Platform) website and that you login to your account using the CLI. If needed, you
can create a new account [here](https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/).


## Login via Web Browser

To log in to your Virtual Cells Platform account using your browser:

```bash
vcp login
```

Once you log in, you can go back to the command line and continue.


## Login via the Command Line

To log in to your Virtual Cells Platform account from your terminal, specify the `--username` option:

```bash
vcp login --username your.name@example.org
```

You will be prompted for a password. Use the same one you use on [the
Virtual Cell Models web page](https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com).
