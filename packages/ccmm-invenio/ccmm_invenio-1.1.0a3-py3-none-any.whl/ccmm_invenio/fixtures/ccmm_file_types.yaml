    Format is typically used to package or bundle software, databases, authored DVD
    video programs, and the like. ISO image files, unlike normal files, are not opened
    but rather are mounted. ISO image files contain the data contents of every written

    can then be stored and emailed as a single entity. A NetworkLink can fetch a KMZ
    file from a web server. When the KMZ file is unzipped, the main .kml file and
    its supporting files are separated into their original formats and directory structure,
    with their original filenames and extensions. In addition to being an archive
    format, the Zip format is also compressed, so an archive can include only a single
    large KML file. Depending on the content of the KML file, this process typically
    results in 10:1 compression. Your 10 Kbyte KML file can be served with a 1 Kbyte
    KMZ file.

  en: A file with the XLSB file extension is an Excel Binary Workbook file. They store
    information in binary format instead of XML like with most other Excel files (like
    XLSX). Since XLSB files are binary, they can be read from and written to much
    faster, making them extremely useful for very large spreadsheets.
