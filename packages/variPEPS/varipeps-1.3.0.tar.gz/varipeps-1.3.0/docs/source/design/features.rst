Features
========

The implementation of variational PEPS supports the following features:

#. Target non-bipartite lattices, example the Honeycomb and the Kagome
   lattice.

#. General unit cell (atleast) for the square lattice

#. Support complex tensors, gpu, etc

#. Different optimizers such as Gradient descent, L-BFGS, etc
