A professional, modular Python library for **Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction with Neural Networks (HCR-NN)**.

---

##  What Is HCR-NN?

HCR-NN enables efficient density estimation and conditional inference on multivariate data using principled statistical modeling wrapped in modern neural network constructs. It is designed for both research and application:

- Model **joint and conditional densities**, e.g., \(ρ(u_1, u_2)\) and \(E[u_1\mid u_2]\).  
- Normalize raw data using empirical or Gaussian CDFs (`CDFNorm`).  
- Approximate densities via **basis expansions** (polynomial, cosine, KDE).  
- Build, train, and visualize **conditional models** with `HCRCond2D`.  
- Integrate with aurhus-propositional modeling workflows & PyTorch pipelines.

---

## ​ Highlights

- **Precise probabilistic modeling** with neural network flexibility.  
- **Modular design**: swap between normalization, basis, model easily.  
- **Reproducible example notebooks** (`examples/`) that run in CI and output artifacts.  
- **Optimized density utilities** for direct density inference and conditional expectation.

<!-- ##  Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateuszwalo/HCR-NN-Library.git
cd HCR-NN-Library
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # includes torch, numpy, pandas, pytest, etc.
``` -->

## Example Workflow: Train and Visualize

```bash
jupyter notebook example_implementation/01_hcrnn_end_to_end.ipynb
```

This notebook demonstrates loading data, normalization, training HCRCond2D, and visualizing 𝐸[𝑢1∣𝑢2]E[u1∣u2].

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of any kind:

Fork the repo and create a branch for your feature or fix.

Add clear documentation and tests (preferably notebooks or pytest) — all examples should run in CI.

Open a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.

Check the test suite `pytest -q` in CI for regression safety.
