# Project Brief: Cakemail API MCP Server

## Executive Summary

**Cakemail API MCP Server** is a Model Context Protocol server that exposes Cakemail's email marketing API to AI agents and development tools through standardized OpenAPI specifications. The project solves the critical challenge of making AI coding assistants and developers deeply aware of Cakemail's API capabilities, enabling them to build integrations faster and more accurately. Targeting both human developers and AI-powered development tools (like Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot), the MCP server will bridge the gap between Cakemail's comprehensive API documentation and modern AI-assisted development workflows. The key value proposition is dramatically reduced integration time and improved code quality by giving AI agents native, structured access to Cakemail's API schema, endpoints, and usage patterns.

## Problem Statement

### **Current State and Pain Points:**

Developers using AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to build Cakemail integrations encounter a **critical accuracy problem**: AI agents **guess** API details rather than reference authoritative specifications. This results in AI-generated code that contains:

- **Hallucinated endpoint URLs** - Wrong paths, incorrect resource naming, non-existent routes
- **Invalid parameters** - Incorrect field names, wrong data types, missing required fields, invented optional parameters
- **Broken authentication flows** - Guessed auth mechanisms (API keys in wrong headers, incorrect OAuth flows, misunderstood token formats)

While Cakemail provides comprehensive API documentation at https://docs.cakemail.com/en/api/account and maintains an OpenAPI specification, **AI agents have no direct access to this authoritative source** during code generation. They rely on training data patterns and statistical guessing, leading to fundamentally broken integration code.

**The developer experience:**
1. Developer asks AI to "create a function to send an email via Cakemail"
2. AI generates code with plausible-looking but **incorrect** endpoint URLs and parameters
3. Developer runs code → authentication failures, 404 errors, validation errors
4. Developer manually looks up correct API details in documentation
5. Developer corrects AI-generated code or re-prompts with copied documentation
6. **Repeat this cycle for every API interaction**

### **Impact:**

**Quantifiable friction:**
- **High error rates:** Every AI-generated API call requires manual verification and correction
- **Broken trust:** Developers learn they cannot trust AI-generated Cakemail integration code
- **Time waste:** Developers spend more time debugging incorrect AI assumptions than if they'd written code manually
- **Integration abandonment:** Frustrated developers may choose competing services with better AI-assisted development support

**Business impact:**
- Slower customer/partner integration cycles (every API call becomes a debugging session)
- Higher support burden (tickets from broken AI-generated integrations)
- Negative developer experience perception (Cakemail seen as "hard to integrate with AI tools")
- Reduced API adoption among AI-assisted development teams (the fastest-growing developer segment)

### **Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

- **API documentation websites** cannot be accessed by AI agents during code generation (they're outside the AI's context window)
- **OpenAPI specs as static files** sit in repositories but aren't queryable by AI tools in real-time
- **Copying docs into prompts** is manual, incomplete, and breaks down as APIs evolve
- **Fine-tuning AI models** on API docs is impractical for individual APIs and becomes stale immediately

### **Urgency and Importance:**

**Now is the critical moment** because:
- **AI-assisted development is the new normal:** 55% of developers now use AI coding tools regularly (Stack Overflow 2024)
- **MCP is the emerging standard:** Model Context Protocol provides the first standardized way for AI agents to access live, authoritative API specifications
- **First-mover advantage:** APIs with MCP servers will become the "easy choice" for AI-assisted development
- **Competitive gap risk:** Services that ignore AI-assisted workflows risk becoming second-tier options as the developer ecosystem shifts

## Proposed Solution

The **Cakemail API MCP Server** provides AI agents with direct, real-time access to authoritative Cakemail API specifications through the Model Context Protocol standard. Instead of guessing, AI tools can query the MCP server to retrieve:

- **Exact endpoint URLs** from the OpenAPI specification
- **Precise parameter schemas** with types, validation rules, and required fields
- **Correct authentication mechanisms** with headers, token formats, and flow details
- **Example requests/responses** showing real usage patterns

### **Core Approach:**

The solution leverages **gofastmcp.com's OpenAPI integration** to create an MCP server that:

1. **Loads Cakemail's OpenAPI specification** (the existing `openapi.json` file)
2. **Exposes API capabilities as MCP tools** that AI agents can discover and invoke
3. **Serves as the authoritative source** for all Cakemail API details during AI-assisted development
4. **Updates automatically** when the OpenAPI spec changes (no stale documentation)

### **Key Differentiators:**

- **Zero-hallucination guarantee:** AI agents get facts from the spec, not statistical guesses
- **Developer-transparent:** Works seamlessly in Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools
- **Always current:** As long as OpenAPI spec is maintained, MCP server reflects latest API state
- **Low maintenance:** Built on gofastmcp framework, minimal custom code required

### **Why This Will Succeed:**

Unlike static documentation or manual copy-paste workflows, the MCP server puts API specifications **inside the AI agent's native tool-calling capabilities**. When a developer asks "send an email via Cakemail," the AI doesn't guess—it queries the MCP server, retrieves the exact `/campaigns/{id}/send` endpoint spec, and generates correct code on the first try.

### **High-Level Vision:**

This positions Cakemail as a leader in AI-assisted development, making it the **easiest email marketing API to integrate** for the growing wave of AI-powered developers and applications.

### **Out of Scope for MVP**

- Live API testing/execution through MCP (read-only spec access only)
- Custom example generation beyond what's in OpenAPI spec
- Multi-language SDK generation
- Analytics dashboard for tracking MCP usage
- Integration with non-MCP AI tools
- Advanced features like API versioning, deprecation warnings, or change notifications
- OAuth flow testing/simulation
- Rate limiting information (unless already in OpenAPI spec)

### **MVP Success Criteria**

The MVP is successful when:
1. A developer can install the Cakemail MCP server in Claude Desktop in <10 minutes
2. AI agent (Claude) can query and receive accurate endpoint specifications from the MCP server
3. Developer using AI assistance generates correct Cakemail API integration code on first attempt (80%+ success in initial user testing)
4. MCP server loads and serves all endpoints from current Cakemail OpenAPI spec without errors
5. At least 3 external beta testers successfully use the MCP server and report positive feedback

## Post-MVP Vision

### **Phase 2 Features**

- **Integration Templates:** Pre-built patterns for common integration scenarios (e-commerce, CRM sync, analytics)
- **Developer Community Features:** Share integration patterns, rate API quality, request improvements

## Technical Considerations

### **Platform Requirements**

- **Target Platforms:** Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) - MCP servers are platform-agnostic
- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js 18+ (gofastmcp requirement)
- **Client Compatibility:** Claude Desktop, Cursor, other MCP-compatible AI tools
- **Performance Requirements:** Query response time <500ms for spec lookups, minimal memory footprint

### **Technology Preferences**

- **Implementation:** TypeScript (type safety, better DX, gofastmcp native language)
- **Framework:** gofastmcp.com OpenAPI integration (proven solution for MCP+OpenAPI)
- **OpenAPI Parser:** Existing library (swagger-parser or openapi-typescript) for spec validation
- **Distribution:** npm package for easy installation, GitHub for source/issues

### **Architecture Considerations**

- **Repository Structure:** Single-repo monolith initially (MCP server + docs + examples)
- **Service Architecture:** Standalone MCP server process, communicates via stdio with AI tools
- **Integration Requirements:**
  - Load `openapi.json` from local file or remote URL
  - Sync with Cakemail's API updates (manual or automated)
  - Validate OpenAPI spec on startup
- **Security/Compliance:**
  - Read-only spec access (no API keys in MVP)
  - No PII or sensitive data storage
  - Open source license (MIT recommended for adoption)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### **Constraints**

- **Budget:** Minimal - primarily engineering time, no infrastructure costs for MVP (local MCP server)
- **Timeline:** Target 4-6 weeks from kickoff to MVP beta release
- **Resources:** 1 developer (part-time or full-time depending on availability)
- **Technical:**
  - Dependent on gofastmcp.com framework capabilities (must validate it supports all needed features)
  - Quality of Cakemail OpenAPI spec (must be accurate, complete, and well-structured)
  - MCP protocol adoption (currently limited to Claude Desktop, Cursor; broader ecosystem TBD)

### **Key Assumptions**

- Cakemail's existing OpenAPI spec is accurate and comprehensive enough to support MVP
- gofastmcp.com framework can handle Cakemail's API complexity without custom extensions
- Developers using AI assistants will discover and try MCP server with minimal marketing
- AI tools (Claude, Cursor) will continue supporting and expanding MCP protocol
- Read-only spec access provides sufficient value for MVP (don't need live API execution)
- Internal team has capacity to maintain OpenAPI spec as API evolves

## Risks & Open Questions

### **Key Risks**

- **gofastmcp Limitations:** Framework may not support all Cakemail API patterns (complex auth, custom extensions) - *Impact: High, Likelihood: Medium*
- **OpenAPI Spec Quality:** If spec is incomplete or inaccurate, MCP server will serve bad data - *Impact: High, Likelihood: Low (assuming existing spec is maintained)*
- **Low Adoption:** Developers may not know about or bother installing MCP server - *Impact: Medium, Likelihood: Medium*
- **MCP Ecosystem Risk:** If MCP protocol fails to gain traction, investment becomes stranded - *Impact: High, Likelihood: Low (Anthropic backing reduces risk)*
- **Maintenance Burden:** Keeping MCP server in sync with API changes could become overhead - *Impact: Medium, Likelihood: Low (if automated)*

### **Open Questions**

- What is the current quality/completeness of Cakemail's OpenAPI specification?
- Does gofastmcp.com support all necessary features, or will custom MCP server code be needed?
- How will we promote MCP server to developers (docs, blog posts, community outreach)?
- What's the process for keeping OpenAPI spec updated as API evolves?
- Should this be open source from day one, or internal beta first?
- How do we measure success in the absence of built-in analytics (user surveys, GitHub stars, support ticket trends)?

### **Areas Needing Further Research**

- **Technical validation:** Hands-on testing of gofastmcp.com with Cakemail's OpenAPI spec
- **Competitive analysis:** Which email/marketing APIs already have MCP servers?
- **User research:** Interview 3-5 developers about their AI-assisted Cakemail integration experiences
- **OpenAPI audit:** Review Cakemail spec for completeness, accuracy, and MCP-readiness

## Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Validate gofastmcp.com capabilities** - Create proof-of-concept with Cakemail OpenAPI spec to confirm technical feasibility (1-2 days)
2. **Audit OpenAPI specification** - Review `openapi.json` for completeness, accuracy, and identify any gaps (1 day)
3. **User research** - Interview 2-3 developers who've built Cakemail integrations to validate problem statement (1 week)
4. **Create technical architecture document** - Detailed design for MCP server implementation (with Architect agent)
5. **Set up development environment** - Repo, tooling, CI/CD pipeline
6. **Begin MVP development** - Start with OpenAPI loader and basic MCP endpoint exposure

### **PM Handoff**

This Project Brief provides the full context for **Cakemail API MCP Server**. The next step is to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) that translates this strategic vision into specific features, user stories, and technical specifications.

**Recommended next agent:** Transform to `*agent pm` (Product Manager - John) to create the PRD, working section by section to define detailed requirements, user flows, and acceptance criteria.
