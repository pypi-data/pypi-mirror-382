The `voici-core` package provides the core functionality for building voici dashboards using the voici CLI.

## Getting Started üèÅ

To use Voici, you'll need to install it first:

```bash
pip install voici-core

# OR BETTER

conda install -c conda-forge voici-core

# OR EVEN FASTER

mamba install -c conda-forge voici-core
```

Then, you can generate static dashboards from a notebook or a directory of Notebooks like this:

```bash
# Build a single dashboard
voici my-notebook.ipynb
# Build a directory of notebooks
voici notebooks/
```

Once your dashboards are built, you can simply serve them with a simple static server, _e.g._:

```bash
cd _output
python -m http.server
```

## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

Because Voici uses Wasm kernels to execute notebooks, there are some limitations to the types of notebooks that can be rendered: Some notebook features may not work correctly or may have limited functionality when rendered in Voici.
