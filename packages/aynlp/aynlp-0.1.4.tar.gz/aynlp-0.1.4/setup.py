LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
AYNLP (Advanced Yet Simple NLP) is a modular and lightweight Python toolkit designed to make 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) accessible, fun, and powerful. With AYNLP, you can:

- Tokenize text and filter stopwords
- Perform stemming and lemmatization
- Tag parts-of-speech (POS) and extract named entities (NER)
- Analyze sentiment using multiple approaches

The library is **easy to use**, highly **extensible**, and ideal for educational, research, and open-source projects.

ðŸ“Œ **Why Contribute?**
- Help enhance NLP functionalities and add new features
- Improve existing modules like tokenization, POS tagging, or sentiment analysis
- Optimize code performance and expand compatibility with other NLP libraries
- Report issues, suggest improvements, and participate in shaping the roadmap of a growing open-source project

ðŸ’¡ **Get Started**
Visit the GitHub repository: [AYNLP](https://github.com/aijadugar/AYNLP) to fork the project, raise issues, or contribute code. Every contribution helps the community and strengthens the toolkit for everyone.

Whether you are a student, researcher, or developer, AYNLP offers a playground for learning and contributing to real-world NLP projects.
