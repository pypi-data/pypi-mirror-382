.TH "DEBOPS" "1" "Oct 09, 2025" "v3.0.12" "DebOps"
.SH NAME
debops \- Your Debian-based data center in a box
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops\fP [\-\-version] [\-h|\-\-help] <section> [<command>] [<args>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The DebOps project is a set of Ansible playbooks, roles, and optional scripts
which can be used to manage IT infrastructure based on Debian or Ubuntu
operating systems, from singhle hosts to entire data centers. The project can
be used to bootstrap bare metal environment, set up local DNS, DHCP, PXEboot
services and from there install and configure Debian or Ubuntu hardware and
virtual machines, as well as LXC and Docker containers.
.sp
DebOps includes a set of Python scripts which provide a wrapper around Ansible
and other tools. The scripts can be used to create and maintain \(dqproject
directories\(dq which contain Ansible inventory, any installed Ansible Collections
and other data related to a given environment. You can also execute Ansible
playbooks from DebOps or other Ansible Collections as well as your own
playbooks using simple commands against the current environment.
.SH THE DEBOPS COMMAND
.sp
The \fBdebops\fP command provides multiple sub\-commands, some of which are
split into sections.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBdebops project\fP
This section includes commands used to create and maintain the \(dqproject
directories\(dq which contain one or multiple Ansible inventories, PKI
infrastructure, GPG keyring, and other resources used in a particular
environment.
.TP
\fBdebops exec\fP
This command can be used to execute Ansible modules ad\-hoc against a given
environment. You can use any arguments accepted by the \fBansible\fP
command \- they will be executed in the DebOps project context, including the
runtime environment variables and with the \fBansible/secret/\fP directory
unlocked if necessary.
.TP
\fBdebops run\fP
This command can be used to execute Ansible playbooks against a given
environment. The playbooks used can come either from the DebOps Python
package (included by default), from an Ansible Collection, or from the
\fBansible/playbooks/\fP directory in a given project. You can also specify
all \fBansible\-playbook\fP arguments to affect the Ansible execution;
.TP
\fBdebops check\fP
This command is the same as the \fBdebops run\fP command above, but
automatically adds the \fB\-\-diff\fP and \fB\-\-check\fP \fBansible\-playbook\fP
options to ensure that the playbooks are executed in a check mode;
.TP
\fBdebops env\fP
This command can be used to inspect the environment variables which will be
present when various DebOps commands are executed. It can also be used to run
shell commands in DebOps environment, which is a handy shortcut for using
Ansible ecosystem with DebOps project directories.
.TP
\fBdebops config\fP
This command allows the user to inspect and manipulate the DebOps
configuration options in various formats;
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can find more information about these subcommands in the DebOps
documentation, \fBdebops\-*\fP manual pages or by running them with the \fB\-\-help\fP
option.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
Display the help and usage information
.TP
.B \fB\-\-version\fP
Display the version of the \fBdebops\fP scripts
.UNINDENT
.SS Verbose mode and logging
.sp
The \fBdebops\fP script can send log messages about its operation to the
\fBsyslog\fP service. Using configuration options, users can specify where
to send the log messages, default log level and facility.
.sp
Users can specify the \fB\-\-verbose\fP or \fB\-v\fP flag in the \fBdebops\fP
subcommands to increase the script verbosity. The flag enables log output to the
standard error (stderr) stream. Multiple uses of the flag increase the log level
from the default \fBWARNING\fP to \fBNOTICE\fP, \fBINFO\fP and \fBDEBUG\fP with \fB\-vvv\fP
respectively.
.sp
To view the logs from \fBdebops\fP using \fBjournald\fP service, run the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
journalctl \-f _COMM=debops
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Environment variables
.sp
These environment variables can be used to affect the environment during script
execution:
