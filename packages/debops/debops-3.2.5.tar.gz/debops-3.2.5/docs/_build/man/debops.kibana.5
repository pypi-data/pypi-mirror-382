.SH NAME
debops.kibana \- Install and manage Kibana dashboard using Ansible
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops run service/kibana\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%Kibana\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibana\fP> is a web interface which
can be used to display and analyze data stored in an Elasticsearch cluster. It
is a part of the Elastic Stack. The software is
developed by \fI\%Elastic\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/\fP>\&.
.sp
The \fBdebops.kibana\fP Ansible role can be used to deploy Kibana behind an
\fBnginx\fP reverse proxy which connects to a local or remote Elasticsearch
cluster. The role can be used as a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow
control over their configuration options in the Kibana configuration file.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Upstream package is used by default
.sp
The \fI\%debops.kibana\fP role depends on the \fI\%debops.extrepo\fP
Ansible role to configure access to the Elastic.co APT repository. This means
that usually the latest available Kibana release will be installed by
default. If you require older releases, you can use the
\fI\%debops.apt_preferences\fP role to select the desired package version.
.sp
Alternatively, you can \(dqmask\(dq the
\fI\%kibana__extrepo__dependent_sources\fP variable in the Ansible
inventory and configure the APT repositories yourself via the \fI\%debops.apt\fP
role.
.SS Kibana is insecure by default
.sp
The Kibana dashboard relies on Elasticsearch to ensure secure communication
between cluster nodes. The default configuration expects an Elasticsearch
instance installed on the same host, preferably in a \(dqload balancer\(dq mode, that
is with no master possibility, no data or ingest functions enabled on the node.
.sp
Kibana by default does not include any authentication or ACL support; however
the role by default does not configure any access restrictions. If you want to
have a simple security solution, you can use \fBkibana__webserver_*\fP variables
to configure HTTP Basic Auth in the \fBnginx\fP frontend. Keep in mind
that once a user is authenticated using this method, he/she has full access to
the Elasticsearch cluster.
.sp
If the first host used for connections to the Elasticsearch cluster uses
a \fBhttps://\fP connection, Kibana will try to use the \fBkibana_system\fP
Elasticsearch user account and password stored in the
\fBsecret/elasticsearch/credentials/<cluster_name>/built\-in/kibana_system/password\fP
file (managed by the \fI\%debops.secret\fP role) to authorize itself with the
cluster and set up its own configuration. After that, you can use other users
(notably \fBelastic\fP superuser account) to access the web interface.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Make sure that the Elasticsearch cluster name specified via the
\fI\%elasticsearch__cluster_name\fP variable is synchronized with
the \fI\%kibana__elasticsearch_cluster_name\fP variable in the
inventory. Otherwise, the \fI\%debops.kibana\fP role might not find
the correct password file and will not connect with the Elasticsearch
cluster.
.sp
The reason for doing it this way is that Kibana can be installed
separately from Elasticsearch (on separate hosts), and there\(aqs no way
for the \fI\%debops.kibana\fP role to find out the correct cluster
name on its own, if it\(aqs not the default.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can install additional plugins that provide encrypted connections,
authentication, authorization and access control:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%X\-Pack\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack\fP>, an Elastic
commercial plugin with free trial period. Supports encryption,
authentication, access control, integrates with Elasticsearch and Logstash.
Since the plugin is developed by the same team, its releases are in parallel
with Kibana.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Search Guard\fP <\fBhttp://floragunn.com/searchguard/\fP>, an open source third
party plugin with commercial support. Has features comparable with X\-Pack,
with more basic features like HTTP and transport encryption, basic
authentication and access control available free of charge.
.UNINDENT
.SS Use as a role dependency
.sp
The Kibana main configuration file
\fI\%does not support an include statement or conf.d directory\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11362\fP>\&.
To mitigate that and allow multiple Kibana configuration sources from other
Ansible roles, the \fBdebops.kibana\fP role supports operation as a dependent
role. This functionality can be used by other Ansible roles to better manage
Kibana plugins or extend the configuration without the need to implement the
entire role again and with preserved idempotency.
.sp
See the \fI\%Usage as a role dependency\fP for more details.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
To deploy Kibana, you can add the host to the
\fB[debops_service_kibana]\fP Ansible inventory group. By default Kibana expects
an Elasticsearch instance on the same host to leverage the cluster load
balancing. To install an ES node in a load balancer configuration, include the
host in the \fB[debops_service_elasticsearch_lb]\fP inventory group:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[debops_service_kibana]
hostname

[debops_service_elasticsearch_lb]

.ft P

See the documentation of the \fBdebops.elasticsearch\fP role about different
Ansible inventory group types and their usage.
.SS Example playbook

.SS Ansible tags
.sp
You can use Ansible \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.
.sp
Available role tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrole::kibana\fP
Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
tasks as well as role dependencies.
.TP
.B \fBrole::kibana:config\fP
Generate the Kibana configuration taking into account different configuration
sources.
.UNINDENT
.SH USAGE AS A ROLE DEPENDENCY
.sp
The \fBdebops.kibana\fP role can be used as a dependency by other Ansible roles
to manage Kibana main configuration file idempotently.  Configuration options
from multiple roles can be merged together and included in the configuration
file, or removed conditionally.
.SS Dependent role variables
.sp
The role exposes three default variables that can be used by other Ansible
roles as dependent variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBkibana__dependent_name\fP
Required. Name of the role that uses the \fBdebops.kibana\fP as a dependency.
This will be used to store the configuration in its own YAML dictionary. The
selected name shouldn\(aqt be changed, otherwise configuration will be
desynchronized.
.TP
.B \fBkibana__dependent_configuration\fP
Required. List of the Kibana configuration options defined in the same format
as the main configuration. See \fI\%kibana__configuration\fP for more
details.
.TP
.B \fBkibana__dependent_state\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the configuration will be included
in the \fB/etc/kibana/kibana.yml\fP configuration file and stored in the
\fBsecret/\fP directory on the Ansible Controller. if \fBabsent\fP, the
configuration will be removed from the generated configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dependent configuration storage and retrieval
.sp
The dependent configuration from other roles is stored in the \fBsecret/\fP
directory on the Ansible Controller (see \fI\%debops.secret\fP for more details) in
a JSON file, with each role configuration in a separate dictionary. The
\fBdebops.kibana\fP role reads this file when Ansible local facts indicate that
the Kibana service is installed, otherwise a new empty file is created.  This
ensures that the stale configuration is not present on a new or re\-installed
host.
.sp
The YAML dictionaries from different roles are be merged with the main
configuration in the \fI\%kibana__combined_configuration\fP variable that is
used to generate the final configuration. The merge order of the different
\fBkibana__*_configuration\fP variables allows to further affect the dependent
configuration through Ansible inventory if necessary, therefore the Ansible
roles that use this method don\(aqt need to provide additional variables for this
purpose themselves.

.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.kibana\fP default variables have more extensive configuration
than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and examples for
them.
.SS kibana__configuration
.sp
The \fBkibana__*_configuration\fP variables define the Kibana configuration
options that are set in the \fB/etc/kibana/kibana.yml\fP configuration file.
.sp
The main Kibana configuration file format is YAML.
The \fI\%reference documentation\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html\fP>
defines two YAML formats recognized by Kibana, hierarchical (YAML dictionary
keys are indented), or flat (YAML dictionary keys are separated by dots). This
role focuses only on the latter, flat format since it\(aqs used everywhere in the
Kibana documentation and seems to be the preferred method for majority of the
configuration options.
.sp
For quick reference, Kibana configuration file contains options in the
following format (similar to Elasticsearch):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cluster.name: example\-cluster
node.name: node\-1
network.host: [ _local_, _site_ ]
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBkibana__*_configuration\fP variables are a YAML lists of dictionaries.
Each YAML dictionary defines an option, or redefines a previously defined
option (the variables are flattened and then processed in order).
.sp
The first YAML dictionary key of each option (in above case, \fBcluster\fP,
\fBnode\fP, \fBnetwork\fP, \fBbootstrap\fP, \fBdiscovery\fP is significant, and is used
to separate configuration options into sections defined by the
\fI\%kibana__configuration_sections\fP variable.
.sp
Configuration options can be defined as YAML dictionaries directly, with the
key being the name of the option, and value being its value:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
kibana__configuration:
  \- \(aqcluster.name\(aq: \(aqexample\-cluster\(aq
  \- \(aqnode.name\(aq: \(aqnode\-1\(aq
  \- \(aqnetwork.host\(aq: [ \(aq_local_\(aq, \(aq_site_\(aq ]
  \- \(aqbootstrap.memory_lock\(aq: True
  \- \(aqdiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes\(aq: 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The extended YAML dictionary format is detected if a YAML dictionary contains
a \fBname\fP key. The dictionaries support specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
String. The name of the Kibana option.
.TP
.B \fBvalue\fP
The value of the Kibana option. Can be a string, a number, a boolean or
a YAML list.
.TP
.B \fBcomment\fP
An optional comment added to the option, either as a string or a YAML text
block.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the option will be included in the
configuration. If \fBabsent\fP, the option will not be included. If
\fBcomment\fP, the option will be present but commented out (it\(aqs an internal
feature and may not work reliably for all cases).
.TP
.B \fBraw\fP
Optional, a YAML text block. The name of the configuration option will be
discarded and used only as a marker for these parameters. The contents of the
\fBraw\fP key will be added as\-is to the configuration file. You can use this
to include more extensive configuration defined as a hierarchical YAML
structure. An example configuration which should be equivalent to the
previous example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

      node.data: true
      node.ingest: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should make sure that the indentation of the YAML parameters is consistent
through the configuration file.
.SS kibana__configuration_sections
.sp
The \fB/etc/kibana/kibana.yml\fP configuration file is structured in informal
\(aqsections\(dq, each section contains configuration options from a specific group
(\fBnode\fP, \fBcluster\fP, etc.). The \fI\%kibana__configuration_sections\fP
contains a YAML list of sections and option types to associate with them. The
order of the entries on the list determines the order of the sections in the
finished configuration file.
.sp
Each section definition is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Name of the section, stored as a comment.
.TP
.B \fBpart\fP or \fBparts\fP
A string or a YAML list of configuration option prefixes (first YAML
dictionary key of a given configuration option). Only the parts defined for
a given section will be included in that section.
.UNINDENT
.sp
After all of the sections are processed, any left over configuration options
not matched with a particular section will be added at the end of the
configuration file.
.SS kibana__plugins
.sp
The \fBkibana__*_plugins\fP variables are YAML lists that can be used to
install or remove Kibana plugins. Support for plugin management using
these variables is minimalistic; you can install plugins known by the Elastic
\fI\%plugin repository\fP <\fBhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kibana-plugins.html\fP>,
or from an URL. More involved management can be done by creating a separate
role and using \fBdebops.kibana\fP as a role dependency to manage
configuration if necessary. See \fI\%Usage as a role dependency\fP for more
details.
.sp
Each element of the list is a YAML dictionary with specific parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required. Name of the plugin that shows up in the output of the
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.TP
.B \fBurl\fP
Optional. If the plugin is distributed via an URL, you can provide it here
for the plugin management script to use instead of the plugin name.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. If not specified or \fBpresent\fP, the plugin and its configuration
will be installed. If \fBabsent\fP the plugin and its configuration will be
removed.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Optional. The system user used for plugin management. Defaults to \fI\%kibana__user\fP\&.
Certain plugins like X\-Pack generate files on installation which Kibana needs
to have write permissions to.
.TP
.B \fBconfiguration\fP or \fBconfig\fP
Optional. Custom configuration for a given plugin, in the format recognized
by the main configuration template.
