.SH NAME
debops.unattended_upgrades \- Configure unattended upgrades on Debian-based hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdebops run service/unattended_upgrades\fP [\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIgroup,host,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-diff\fP] [\fB\-\-check\fP] [\fB\-\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [\fB\-\-skip\-tags\fP \fItag1,tag2,\fP\&...] [<\fBansible\-playbook\fP options>] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBunattended\-upgrades\fP package manages \fI\%automatic, unattended upgrades\fP <\fBhttps://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades\fP> of the Debian\-based hosts. You
can specify what package origins are included in the unattended upgrades, as
well as specify what packages should be exempt from the upgrades, among other
things.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.SS Initial configuration
.sp
The \fBunattended\-upgrades\fP package will be configured differently depending on
whether or not a DNS domain is configured on the host:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
if the \fBansible_domain\fP variable is not empty (domain is present), only
packages released through the security repository of a given OS distribution
will be upgraded automatically. E\-mail messages with the information about
the unattended upgrades will be sent to the \fBroot@{{ ansible_domain }}\fP
mail account.
.IP \(bu 2
if the \fBansible_domain\fP variable is empty, role assumes that the host is
a workstation or a laptop (end\-user device) and will configure the
\fBunattended\-upgrades\fP package to upgrade packages from all official
repositories of the given OS distribution (main, updates, backports,
security). The e\-mail messages about the upgrades won\(aqt be generated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can control the above behaviour using \fI\%unattended_upgrades__release\fP and
\fI\%unattended_upgrades__mail_to\fP default variables.
.SS Example inventory
.sp
\fBdebops.unattended_upgrades\fP is included by default in the \fBcommon.yml\fP
DebOps playbook; you don\(aqt need to do anything to have it installed.
.sp
If you want to disable the \fBunattended\-upgrades\fP service on a host or
set of hosts, you can do this by the setting variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
unattended_upgrades__enabled: False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
in Ansible\(aqs inventory. The \fBunattended\-upgrades\fP package won\(aqt be installed.
If it is already present on the host, it won\(aqt be removed, but its
configuration will be reset to the distribution defaults.
.SS Example playbook
.sp
Here\(aqs an example playbook that can be used to enable and manage the
\fBunattended\-upgrades\fP service on a set of hosts:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-

\- name: Manage unattended APT upgrades
  collections: [ \(aqdebops.debops\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles01\(aq,
                 \(aqdebops.roles02\(aq, \(aqdebops.roles03\(aq ]
  hosts: [ \(aqdebops_all_hosts\(aq, \(aqdebops_service_unattended_upgrades\(aq ]
  become: True

  environment: \(aq{{ inventory__environment | d({})
                   | combine(inventory__group_environment | d({}))
                   | combine(inventory__host_environment  | d({})) }}\(aq

  roles:

    \- role: unattended_upgrades
      tags: [ \(aqrole::unattended_upgrades\(aq, \(aqskip::unattended_upgrades\(aq ]

.SS Use as a role dependency
.sp
The \fBdebops.unattended_upgrades\fP Ansible role can be used by other Ansible
roles as a dependency, to allow unattended upgrades of packages from other
repositories than the official ones, or allow automatic blacklisting of
important packages by a given Ansible role. To do this, you can specify
\fBdebops.unattended_upgrades\fP role as a dependency and use two custom
variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fI\%unattended_upgrades__dependent_origins\fP
This is a list of package origins which should be considered for unattended
upgrades of packages.
.TP
.B \fI\%unattended_upgrades__dependent_blacklist\fP
This is a list of APT packages which should be exempt from unattended
upgrades.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Configuration passed to the role through above variables will be stored on the
remote host in Ansible local facts. This prevents idempotency loops and allows
users to use \fBdebops.unattended_upgrades\fP in different playbooks without
issues. This method works on the host with unattended upgrades disabled through
Ansible inventory.
.SH DEFAULT VARIABLE DETAILS
.sp
Some of \fBdebops.unattended_upgrades\fP default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.
.SS unattended_upgrades__blacklist
.sp
The \fI\%unattended_upgrades__blacklist\fP and similar lists allow you to specify
packages which shouldn\(aqt be upgraded automatically. The lists can be nested. You
can specify them as simple package names or dictionaries with specific keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
Required, string or list specifying a package name to include in the
blacklist.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Required. Choices:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBpresent\fP
The specified package(s) will be added in the blacklist.
.TP
.B \fBabsent\fP
The specified package(s) will be removed in the blacklist.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Examples
.sp
Include specified packages in the upgrade blacklist on all hosts:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
unattended_upgrades__blacklist:

  \- \(aqzsh\(aq

  \- name: \(aqpostgresql\(aq
    state: \(aq{{ \(dqpresent\(dq if (ansible_hostname in [ \(dqdatabase\(dq, \(dqdb\(dq ]) else \(dqabsent\(dq }}\(aq

  \- name: [ \(aq^linux\-.*\(aq, \(aqvim\(aq ]
    state: \(aq{{ \(dqpresent\(dq
              if (ansible_local | d() and ansible_local.tags | d()
                  and \(dqproduction\(dq in ansible_local.tags)
              else \(dqabsent\(dq }}\(aq
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.SS unattended_upgrades__origins
.sp
The \fI\%unattended_upgrades__origins\fP and
\fI\%unattended_upgrades__dependent_origins\fP lists define origin patterns of
repositories that will be considered for unattended package upgrades.
The lists can be nested.
You can specify them as simple origin patterns or dictionaries with specific
keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBorigin\fP
Required, string or list of origin patterns.
.sp
Alternatively, \fBorigins\fP also works.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
Required. Choices:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBpresent\fP
The specified origin patterns will be considered for unattended package upgrades.
.TP
.B \fBabsent\fP
The specified origin patterns will be not considered for unattended package upgrades.

.SS Origins syntax
.sp
Lines below have the format format is \fBkeyword=value,...\fP\&.  A
package will be upgraded only if the values in its metadata match
all the supplied keywords in a line.  (In other words, omitted
keywords are wild cards.) The keywords originate from the Release
file, but several aliases are accepted.  The accepted keywords are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
a,archive,suite (eg, \(dqstable\(dq)
c,component     (eg, \(dqmain\(dq, \(dqcrontrib\(dq, \(dqnon\-free\(dq)
l,label         (eg, \(dqDebian\(dq, \(dqDebian\-Security\(dq)
o,origin        (eg, \(dqDebian\(dq, \(dqUnofficial Multimedia Packages\(dq)
n,codename      (eg, \(dqjessie\(dq, \(dqjessie\-updates\(dq)
  site          (eg, \(dqhttp.debian.net\(dq)
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The available values on the system are printed by the command
\(dqapt\-cache policy\(dq, and can be debugged by running
\(dqunattended\-upgrades \-d\(dq and looking at the log file.
.sp
Within lines unattended\-upgrades allows 2 macros whose values are
derived from \fB/etc/debian_version\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
${distro_id}            Installed origin.
${distro_codename}      Installed codename (eg, \(dqjessie\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Codename based matching:
This will follow the migration of a release through different
archives (e. g. from testing to stable and later oldstable):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\(dqo=Debian,n=jessie\(dq;
\(dqo=Debian,n=jessie\-updates\(dq;

\(dqo=Debian,n=jessie,l=Debian\-Security\(dq;
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Archive or Suite based matching:
Note that this will silently match a different release after
migration to the specified archive (e. g. testing becomes the
new stable):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\(dqo=Debian,a=stable\(dq;
