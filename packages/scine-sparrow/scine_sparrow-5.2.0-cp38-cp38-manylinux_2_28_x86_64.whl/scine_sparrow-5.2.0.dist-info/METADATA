SCINE - Sparrow
===============

Introduction
------------

Sparrow is a code for fast semiempirical quantum chemical calculations. It
provides the following methods:

- MNDO
- AM1
- RM1
- PM3
- PM6
- non-SCC DFTB (DFTB0)
- DFTB2
- DFTB3

Sparrow can calculate electronic energies, nuclear gradients and
Hessians for the electronic ground state, as well as electronic vertical
transition energies and the electronic transition dipoles.
