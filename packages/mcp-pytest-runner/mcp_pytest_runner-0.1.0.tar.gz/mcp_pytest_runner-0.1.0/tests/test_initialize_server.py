    This test verifies the Parse Don't Validate philosophy: validation failures provide
    structured, actionable error information for AI agents to correct and retry.

    Single assertion: ValueError exception contains ProtocolError with all required fields.

    BUG EXPOSED BY THIS TEST:
    The field_validator raises plain ValueError, but Pydantic wraps it in ValidationError.
    The initialize_server function catches ValidationError and creates ProtocolValidationError,
    but the current implementation doesn't properly extract the ValidationError details.
    This test SHOULD FAIL because error.protocol_error won't have the correct field values.
