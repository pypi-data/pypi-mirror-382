## 🤔 Understanding the "File Already Exists" Error

### What the Error Means:
```
ERROR: This filename has already been used, use a different version.
```

This is **GOOD NEWS!** It means:
- ✅ Your package is **already published** on PyPI
- ✅ Version 0.1.0 is **live and working**
- ❌ You're trying to upload it **again** (not allowed)

### Why This Happens:
**PyPI doesn't allow overwriting versions** - once a version is published, it's permanent. This is by design for:
- **Security**: Prevents malicious updates to existing versions
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures `pip install observatory-mcp==0.1.0` always gets the same code
- **Trust**: Users can rely on version immutability

### The Solution:
I've updated your workflow to add `skip-existing: true`, so it will gracefully skip uploading if the version already exists.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Users

### Installation
```bash
pip install observatory-mcp
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from observatory_mcp import ObservatorySDK
from mcp.server import Server

# Create your MCP server
app = Server("my-server")

# Add Observatory monitoring (just 2 lines!)
sdk = ObservatorySDK(api_key="your-api-key")
app = sdk.wrap_server(app)

# Done! Your server now has comprehensive analytics
```

## 🔄 Publishing Future Versions

When you want to release a new version:

### 1. Update Version in `pyproject.toml`
```toml
[project]
name = "observatory-mcp"
version = "0.1.1"  # or 0.2.0, 1.0.0, etc.
```

### 2. Update CHANGELOG.md
```markdown
## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-10
### Fixed
- Bug in message interceptor
- Performance improvement in privacy manager
```

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.1"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Create Tag and Release
```bash
# Create tag
git tag v0.1.1

# Push tag
git push origin v0.1.1

# Create GitHub Release (triggers workflow)
gh release create v0.1.1 \
  --title "v0.1.1 - Bug Fixes" \
  --notes "See CHANGELOG.md for details" \
  --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk
```

### 5. Workflow Automatically:
