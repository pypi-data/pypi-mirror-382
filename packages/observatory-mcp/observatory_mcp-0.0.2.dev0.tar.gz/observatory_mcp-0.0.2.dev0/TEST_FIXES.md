# Test Fixes Summary - Event Loop & MCP Dependency Issues

## ✅ All Tests Now Passing!

Fixed critical test failures that were occurring in CI/CD pipeline.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: RuntimeError - No Event Loop in Thread

**Error**:
```
RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'.
```

**Root Cause**:
- `asyncio.Queue` and `asyncio.Event` were being created in `__init__()` 
- These require an active event loop, which doesn't exist during test instantiation
- Affected tests: `test_sdk_initialization`, `test_sdk_with_custom_config`, and async tests

**Solution**:
Changed from eager initialization to lazy initialization:

```python
# BEFORE (❌ broken)
def __init__(self, ...):
    self._event_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=...)  # Error: no event loop!
    self._shutdown_event = asyncio.Event()

# AFTER (✅ fixed)
def __init__(self, ...):
    self._event_queue: Optional[asyncio.Queue] = None
    self._shutdown_event: Optional[asyncio.Event] = None

async def start(self) -> str:
    # Initialize only when needed (event loop exists)
    if self._event_queue is None:
        self._event_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=...)
    if self._shutdown_event is None:
        self._shutdown_event = asyncio.Event()
```

**Files Modified**:
- `observatory_mcp/sdk.py`:
  - Lines 75-78: Changed to `Optional` types
  - Lines 102-108: Added lazy initialization in `start()`
  - Lines 238-240: Added None check in `_handle_event()`
  - Line 368: Added None check in `_send_heartbeats()`
  - Line 407: Added None check in `get_stats()`

### Issue 2: MCP Dependency Missing in CI

**Error**:
```
AssertionError: Regex pattern did not match.
 Regex: 'Expected mcp.server.Server'
 Input: 'MCP package not installed. Install with: pip install mcp'
```

**Root Cause**:
- `mcp` package was only in `[project.optional-dependencies]`
- CI runs `pip install -e ".[dev]"` which didn't include `mcp`
- Tests that use `wrap_server()` need MCP to be installed

**Solution**:
Added `mcp` to dev dependencies:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "mcp>=0.9.0",  # ✅ Required for testing MCP integration
    "pytest>=7.0",
    ...
]
```

**Files Modified**:
- `pyproject.toml`: Added `mcp>=0.9.0` to dev dependencies

## 📊 Test Results

### Before Fixes
```
❌ 3 failed, 55 passed, 3 errors in 4.11s
```

**Failed Tests**:
- `test_sdk_initialization` - RuntimeError
- `test_sdk_with_custom_config` - RuntimeError
- `test_wrap_server_wrong_type` - AssertionError

**Errors**:
- `test_sdk_start_success` - RuntimeError

- `test_sdk_stop` - RuntimeError

### After Fixes
```
✅ 61 passed in 4.07s
✅ 82% coverage maintained
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Lazy Initialization Pattern

The fix implements the lazy initialization pattern for async objects:

1. **Declaration**: Type hints as `Optional[...]` in `__init__()`
2. **Initialization**: Create actual objects in `async def start()` when event loop exists
3. **Safety**: Add None checks wherever objects are accessed

### None Safety Checks Added

```python
# In _handle_event()
if not self._event_queue:
    logger.warning("Event queue not initialized, dropping event")
    return

# In get_stats()
"queue_size": self._event_queue.qsize() if self._event_queue else 0

# In _send_heartbeats()
"queue_size": self._event_queue.qsize() if self._event_queue else 0
```

## ✅ Verification

All checks now pass:

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Tests** | ✅ PASS | 61/61 passed |
| **Coverage** | ✅ PASS | 82% (maintained) |
| **Ruff** | ✅ PASS | All checks passed |
| **Black** | ✅ PASS | All files formatted |

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Status

The following CI/CD pipeline steps will now succeed:

1. ✅ **Lint with ruff** - Passes
2. ✅ **Check formatting with black** - Passes  
3. ✅ **Run tests** - All 61 tests pass
4. ✅ **Build package** - Success

## 📝 Files Changed

| File | Changes | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `observatory_mcp/sdk.py` | Lazy initialization + None checks | 8 locations |
| `pyproject.toml` | Added mcp to dev dependencies | 1 line |

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Async Object Creation**: Never create asyncio objects (`Queue`, `Event`) in `__init__()` - use lazy initialization
2. **Test Dependencies**: Include all dependencies needed for tests in dev dependencies, even if they're optional at runtime
3. **Defensive Programming**: Always check for None when using lazily-initialized objects

---

## 🎉 Result

**All CI/CD checks will now pass!**

The SDK is production-ready with:
- ✅ Proper async initialization
- ✅ All dependencies included for testing
- ✅ 61 passing tests
- ✅ 82% code coverage
- ✅ Zero linting issues
- ✅ Proper formatting

Ready to merge and deploy! 🚀
