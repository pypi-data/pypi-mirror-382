# Workflow Permission Fix Applied ✅

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Error:
```
⚠️ Unexpected error fetching GitHub release for tag refs/tags/v0.1.0
HttpError: Resource not accessible by integration
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

### The Problem:
The workflow had **read-only** permissions for contents:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # For PyPI publishing
  contents: read   # ❌ Too restrictive!
```

The `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` action needs **write** permissions to:
- Create GitHub releases
- Upload release assets (dist files)
- Update release information

### The Fix:
Changed to **write** permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # For PyPI publishing
  contents: write  # ✅ Now can create releases!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps: Trigger the Workflow Again

Since you already pushed the tag `v0.1.0`, you need to recreate it with the updated workflow:

### Option 1: Delete and Recreate Release (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Delete the old release (if it exists)
gh release delete v0.1.0 --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk --yes

# 2. Delete the local tag
cd /Users/amannhq/Desktop/Me/observatory/sdk/python-sdk
git tag -d v0.1.0

# 3. Delete the remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0

# 4. Recreate the tag
git tag v0.1.0

# 5. Push the tag (this will trigger the workflow with updated permissions!)
git push origin v0.1.0

# 6. Create the release (this triggers the workflow)
gh release create v0.1.0 \
  --title "v0.1.0 - Initial Release" \
  --notes "🎉 Initial release of Observatory MCP Python SDK

## ✨ Features
- 2-line integration for MCP servers
- Smart sampling and privacy controls  
- Comprehensive analytics and monitoring
- 82% test coverage
- Full type safety (mypy compliant)
- Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 support

## 📦 Installation
\`\`\`bash
pip install observatory-mcp
\`\`\`

## 🚀 Quick Start
\`\`\`python
from observatory_mcp import ObservatorySDK
from mcp.server import Server

app = Server(\"my-server\")
sdk = ObservatorySDK(api_key=\"your-api-key\")
app = sdk.wrap_server(app)
\`\`\`

See [README.md](https://github.com/amannhq/observatory-python-sdk#readme) for full documentation." \
  --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk
```

---

### Option 2: Create a New Version Tag

If you want to keep v0.1.0 as-is, create a new patch version:

```bash
cd /Users/amannhq/Desktop/Me/observatory/sdk/python-sdk

# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml (optional)
# version = "0.1.1"

# 2. Create and push new tag
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1

# 3. Create release
gh release create v0.1.1 \
  --title "v0.1.1 - Initial Release" \
  --notes "Initial release" \
  --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk
```

---

### Option 3: Use workflow_dispatch (Manual Trigger)

If you've already configured PyPI trusted publishing:

```bash
# Manually trigger the workflow
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk \
  --ref main \
  -f pypi-repo=pypi
```

---

## ✅ What Will Happen Now

After creating the release with the fixed workflow:

```
1. ✅ Workflow triggers with contents: write permission
2. ✅ Builds the package
3. ✅ Publishes to PyPI (if trusted publishing is configured)
4. ✅ Creates/updates GitHub release
5. ✅ Uploads dist files to release assets
```

---

## 🔍 Monitor the Workflow

### Watch in real-time:
```bash
gh run watch --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk
```

### View all runs:
```bash
gh run list --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk
```

### Check specific run:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk --log
```

---

## 📊 Verify Success

After the workflow completes successfully:

### 1. Check GitHub Release
```bash
gh release view v0.1.0 --repo amannhq/observatory-python-sdk
```

Should show:
- ✅ Release exists
- ✅ Has dist files attached (`.whl` and `.tar.gz`)
- ✅ Has release notes

### 2. Check PyPI
```bash
curl https://pypi.org/pypi/observatory-mcp/json | jq '.info.version'
# Should return: "0.1.0"
```

### 3. Test Installation
```bash
pip install observatory-mcp
python -c "import observatory_mcp; print(observatory_mcp.__version__)"
# Should print: 0.1.0
```

## 📝 Summary of Changes

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/publish.yml` | `contents: read` → `contents: write` | Allow release creation and asset uploads |

**Commit:** `9eb761d`
**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub

---

## ⚠️ Don't Forget!

Before the workflow can publish to PyPI, you still need to:

### Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing

1. Go to: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Scroll to "Pending publishers"
3. Click "Add a pending publisher"
4. Fill in:
   ```
   PyPI Project Name:    observatory-mcp
   Owner:                amannhq  
   Repository name:      observatory-python-sdk
   Workflow name:        publish.yml
   Environment name:     (leave blank)
   ```
5. Click "Add"

Without this, the workflow will still fail at the PyPI publishing step (but the GitHub release will succeed now!).

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. ✅ **Delete old tag/release** (see Option 1 above)
2. ✅ **Configure PyPI trusted publishing** (if not done yet)
3. ✅ **Recreate tag and release** (this triggers fixed workflow)
4. ✅ **Watch workflow** complete successfully
5. ✅ **Verify** package is on PyPI

---

## 🎉 Expected Final Result

```bash
# GitHub Release
✅ https://github.com/amannhq/observatory-python-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.0

# PyPI Package  
✅ https://pypi.org/project/observatory-mcp/

# Installation
✅ pip install observatory-mcp works!
```

**Status:** Workflow fix applied and pushed. Ready to recreate release! 🚀
