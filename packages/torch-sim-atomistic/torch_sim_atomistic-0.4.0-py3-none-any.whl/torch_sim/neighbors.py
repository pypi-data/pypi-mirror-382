    """Compute a neighbor list for an atomic configuration.

    ASE periodic neighbor list implementation
    Atoms outside periodic boundaries are mapped into the unit cell. Atoms
    outside non-periodic boundaries are included in the neighbor list
    but complexity of neighbor list search for those can become n^2.
    The neighbor list is sorted by first atom index 'i', but not by second
    atom index 'j'.

    Args:
        quantities: Quantities to compute by the neighbor list algorithm. Each character
            in this string defines a quantity. They are returned in a tuple of
            the same order. Possible quantities are
                * 'i' : first atom index
                * 'j' : second atom index
                * 'd' : absolute distance
                * 'D' : distance vector
                * 'S' : shift vector (number of cell boundaries crossed by the bond
                  between atom i and j). With the shift vector S, the
                  distances D between atoms can be computed from:
                  D = positions[j]-positions[i]+S.dot(cell)
        pbc: 3-tuple indicating giving periodic boundaries in the three Cartesian
            directions.
        cell: Unit cell vectors according to the row vector convention, i.e.
            `[[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], [c1, c2, c3]]`.
        positions: Atomic positions. Anything that can be converted to an ndarray of
            shape (n, 3) will do: [(x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2), ...]. If
            use_scaled_positions is set to true, this must be scaled positions.
        cutoff: Cutoff for neighbor search. It can be:
            * A single float: This is a global cutoff for all elements.
            * A dictionary: This specifies cutoff values for element
              pairs. Specification accepts element numbers of symbols.
              Example: {(1, 6): 1.1, (1, 1): 1.0, ('C', 'C'): 1.85}
            * A list/array with a per atom value: This specifies the radius of
              an atomic sphere for each atoms. If spheres overlap, atoms are
              within each others neighborhood.
              See :func:`~ase.neighborlist.natural_cutoffs`
              for an example on how to get such a list.
        device: PyTorch device to use for computations
        dtype: PyTorch data type to use
        self_interaction: Return the atom itself as its own neighbor if set to true.
            Default: False
        use_scaled_positions: If set to true, positions are expected to be
            scaled positions.
        max_n_bins: Maximum number of bins used in neighbor search. This is used to limit
            the maximum amount of memory required by the neighbor list.

    Returns:
        list[torch.Tensor]: One tensor for each item in `quantities`. Indices in `i`
            are returned in ascending order 0..len(a)-1, but the order of (i,j)
            pairs is not guaranteed.

    """Compute neighbor lists using primitive neighbor list algorithm.

    This function provides a standardized interface for computing neighbor lists
    in atomic systems, wrapping the more general primitive_neighbor_list implementation.
    It handles both periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions and returns
    neighbor pairs along with their periodic shifts.

    The function follows ASE's neighbor list conventions (see ASE:
    https://gitlab.com/ase/ase/-/blob/master/ase/neighborlist.py?ref_type=heads#L152
    but provides a simplified interface focused on the most common use case of
    getting neighbor pairs and shifts.

    Key Features:
    - Handles both periodic and non-periodic systems
    - Returns both neighbor indices and shift vectors for periodic systems
    - Optional sorting of neighbors by first index for better memory access patterns
    - Fully compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation

    Args:
        positions: Atomic positions tensor of shape (num_atoms, 3)
        cell: Unit cell vectors according to the row vector convention, i.e.
            `[[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], [c1, c2, c3]]`.
        pbc: Whether to use periodic boundary conditions (applied to all directions)
        cutoff: Maximum distance for considering atoms as neighbors
        sort_id: If True, sort neighbors by first atom index for better memory
            access patterns

    Returns:
        tuple containing:
            - mapping: Tensor of shape (2, num_neighbors) containing pairs of
              atom indices that are neighbors. Each column (i,j) represents a
              neighbor pair.
            - shifts: Tensor of shape (num_neighbors, 3) containing the periodic
              shift vectors needed to get the correct periodic image for each
              neighbor pair.

    Example:
        >>> # Get neighbors for a periodic system
        >>> positions = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]])
        >>> cell = torch.eye(3) * 10.0
        >>> mapping, shifts = standard_nl(positions, cell, True, 1.5)
        >>> print(mapping)  # Shows pairs of neighboring atoms
        >>> print(shifts)  # Shows corresponding periodic shifts

    Notes:
        - The function uses primitive_neighbor_list internally but provides a simpler
          interface
        - For non-periodic systems (pbc=False), shifts will be zero vectors
        - The neighbor list includes both (i,j) and (j,i) pairs for complete force
          computation
        - Memory usage scales with system size and number of neighbors per atom
