# Prefect MCP Server Documentation

## Overview

Prefect MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that provides integration with the Prefect API. It allows AI assistants and MCP clients to interact with Prefect workflows, deployments, and flow runs through standardized MCP tools.

The server implements the full MCP specification and provides a comprehensive set of CRUD operations for managing Prefect entities.

## Features

The Prefect MCP server provides the following capabilities:

### Flow Operations
- Get flow by ID or name
- List all flows with pagination
- Search flows by name and tags
- Filter flows with custom criteria

### Flow Run Operations
- Get flow run by ID
- List flow runs with pagination
- Search flow runs by state
- Cancel flow runs
- Create new flow runs from deployments

### Deployment Operations
- Get deployment by ID or name
- List deployments with pagination
- Search deployments by schedule status
- Filter deployments with custom criteria

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install prefect-mcp-server
```

Alternatively, install using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv):

```bash
uv pip install prefect-mcp-server
```

## Building & Publishing Releases

1. Update `version` in `pyproject.toml` and record notable changes in `docs/prefect_mcp_documentation.md`.
2. Rebuild artifacts:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make build
   ls dist/
   ```
   The `dist/` directory should now contain a fresh `.whl` and `.tar.gz`.
3. Upload to PyPI using Twine via uv (requires `TWINE_USERNAME`/`TWINE_PASSWORD` or an API token in `TWINE_PASSWORD`):
   ```bash
   uv run twine upload dist/* --skip-existing
   ```
4. Verify the new version on https://pypi.org/project/prefect-mcp-server/ and install it locally to confirm:
   ```bash
   uv pip install --upgrade prefect-mcp-server==<new_version>
   ```

## Getting Started

### Running the Server

You can run the server directly from the command line:

```bash
prefect-mcp-server
```

### Environment Configuration

The server can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `PREFECT_API_URL`: URL of the Prefect API (default: "http://localhost:4200/api")
- `PREFECT_API_KEY`: API key for the Prefect API (optional)

### Using with MCP Inspector

To test the server with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
mcp dev prefect_mcp_server_pkg/server.py
```

### Using with Claude Desktop

To install the server in Claude Desktop:

```bash
mcp install prefect_mcp_server_pkg/server.py
```

## Prefect 3.0 Compatibility

As of version 1.1.2, the server fully supports Prefect 3.0 and its updated API. The main changes include:

- Updated parameter names for the filters in client methods:
  - `flow_filter=` instead of `filter=`
  - `flow_run_filter=` instead of `filter=`
  - `deployment_filter=` instead of `filter=`
