## Prior implementations of HTML in Python

htpy was heavily inspired by many other libraries that came before it.

- [JSX/React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) - Made writing HTML in a programming language popular.
- [pyxl](https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl), [pyxl3](https://github.com/gvanrossum/pyxl3), [pyxl4](https://github.com/pyxl4/pyxl4) - Write HTML in Python with JSX-like syntax. Not actively maintained.
- [htbuilder](https://github.com/tvst/htbuilder/) - Very similar to htpy but does not currently support automatic escaping.
- [nevow.stan](https://github.com/twisted/nevow/blob/master/nevow/stan.py) - Probably the earliest use of `[]` syntax for specifying children. Not actively maintained.
- [breve](https://github.com/cwells/breve) - Another early implementation of HTML in Python, Using getattr `[]` syntax for children. Not actively maintained.
- [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) - JavaScript library that also uses CSS selector-like syntax for specifying id and classes.
- [hyperpython](https://github.com/ejplatform/hyperpython) - A Python interpretation of hyperscript. Not actively maintained.
- [h by Adam Johnson](https://github.com/adamchainz/h) - Similar to htpy, uses call syntax (`()`) for attributes and getitem (`[]`) for children.
- [lxml.builder](https://lxml.de/apidoc/lxml.builder.html) - lxml's `E` allows creating XML/XHTML documents from Python.
