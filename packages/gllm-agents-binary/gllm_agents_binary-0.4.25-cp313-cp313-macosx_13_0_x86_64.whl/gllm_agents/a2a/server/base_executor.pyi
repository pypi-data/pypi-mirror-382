    This class extends the A2A SDK's `AgentExecutor`. It serves as a common
    foundation for specific executors tailored to different agent types within the
    `gllm-agents` framework, such as `LangGraphA2AExecutor` or
    `GoogleADKA2AExecutor`.

    Subclasses are required to implement the `execute` method to handle A2A
    requests. The `cancel` method has a common implementation.

    Attributes:
        _active_tasks (dict[str, asyncio.Task]): A dictionary mapping task IDs to
            their corresponding asyncio.Task instances for active agent executions.

        Implementations should interact with the underlying agent (e.g., a LangGraph
        or Google ADK agent) based on the provided `context`. All communications
        regarding task status, artifacts, and completion must be sent through
        the `event_queue`.

        This method typically involves:
        1. Calling `_handle_initial_execute_checks` for validation and setup.
        2. Defining an agent-specific coroutine for processing (e.g., `_process_stream`).
        3. Calling `_execute_agent_processing` to manage the lifecycle of this coroutine.

        Args:
            context (RequestContext): The request context containing information about the incoming
                     message, task, and other relevant data.
            event_queue (EventQueue): The queue used to send events (e.g., task status updates,
                         artifacts) back to the A2A server infrastructure.

        This method attempts to cancel an active asyncio.Task associated with the
        given `context.task_id`. It waits for a short period for the task to handle
        the cancellation gracefully. The `event_queue` is used to report the
        outcome of the cancellation attempt (e.g., success, error during cleanup).

        Args:
            context (RequestContext): The request context for the task to be cancelled,
                primarily used to get the `task_id` and `context_id`.
            event_queue (EventQueue): The queue for sending cancellation status events.
