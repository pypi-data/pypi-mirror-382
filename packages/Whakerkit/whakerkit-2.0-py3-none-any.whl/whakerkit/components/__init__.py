    This registry is global and shared across all imports. To extend components,
    ensure that the module registering custom components (e.g., components_extend)
    is imported **before** any calls to get() or all(), so that register() runs in time.

    >>> Components.register('MyWidget', MyWidgetNode.REQUIRED)
