        - Has a value from the Biolink related_to hierarchy. In RDF,  this corresponds
          to rdf:predicate and in Neo4j this corresponds to the relationship type.
          The convention is for an edge label in snake_case form. For example, biolink:related_to,
          biolink:causes, biolink:treats
