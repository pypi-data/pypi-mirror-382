# Transformer Examples

This folder contains examples that serve as both documentation and unit tests.

Each subfolder contains independent examples, that contain at least:

 - 1 source schema
 - 1 transformation
 - 1 test input data file (conforming to source schema)

when the test suite is executed, it will include a derived schema for each source schema, plus one output file
for every input file. If these files exist, then the contents of a fresh derivation is checked against them.

The folder layout is:

 - `foobar`
   - `source`
     - `foo.yaml` ## source schema
   - `transform`
     - `foo-to-bar.transform.yaml` ## transformer spec
   - `target`
     - `bar.yaml` ## target schema (autogenerated if not present)
   - `data`
     - `Foo-001.yaml` ## Example file 1, instantiating Foo class for foo schema
     - `Foo-002.yaml` ## Example file 2, instantiating Foo class for foo schema
     - ...
   - `output` ## derived files, conforming to bar (autogenerated if not present)
     - `Bar-001.yaml`
     - `Bar-002.yaml` 

Optionally, an `instructions.yaml` file may be present. If not the structure of the folder is inferred.
