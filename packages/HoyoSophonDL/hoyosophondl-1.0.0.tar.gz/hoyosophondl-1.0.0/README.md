# HoyoSophonDL

**HoyoSophonDL** is a Python-based tool that replicates and simplifies the core functionality of HoYoPlay's internal downloader systems — inspired by  
[Hi3Helper.Sophon](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Hi3Helper.Sophon) and [SophonDownloader](https://github.com/Escartem/SophonDownloader).

It supports both **CLI** and **GUI** modes, allowing users to download and manage HoYoPlay game assets efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Goal & Purpose

**HoyoSophonDL** is a **Python-native reimplementation** of HoYoPlay’s internal downloader logic.  
Its primary goals are to:

- Provide a **lightweight**, **cross-platform**, and **open-source** downloader for HoYoPlay assets.  
- Offer both a **command-line interface (CLI)** and a **PyQt6 GUI** for convenience.  
- Enable **multi-threaded**, **resumable**, and **cancelable** downloads.  
- Simplify asset management, manifest parsing, and patch version handling.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This is an **unofficial third-party tool** unaffiliated with HoYoverse or Cognosphere.  
> It is designed purely for **educational and experimental purposes**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **CLI downloader** with progress tracking via `rich`
- 🖥️ **PyQt6 GUI** with progress bars, pause/resume/cancel controls
- ⚙️ Multi-threaded downloads using `ThreadPoolExecutor`

- 🔄 Asset validation and integrity checks
- 📦 Optional standalone `.exe` builder (Windows)

## 🏗️ Building Executables (Windows)

You can turn your Python project into a standalone `.exe` using **auto-py-to-exe**

or check the release page: [HoyoSophonDL GUI for windows 64bit](https://github.com/Jo0X01/HoyoSophonDL/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

---

## 🧱 Architecture Target

Your build’s architecture (x86 or x64) depends on your **Python interpreter**:
- To build **x64**, use 64-bit Python.
- To build **x86**, install 32-bit Python and rebuild.
