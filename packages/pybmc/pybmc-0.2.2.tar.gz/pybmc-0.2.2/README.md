# pyBMC: A General Bayesian Model Combination Package

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-86%25-brightgreen)](https://ascsn.github.io/pybmc/coverage/)

pyBMC is a Python package for performing Bayesian Model Combination (BMC) on various predictive models. It provides tools for data handling, orthogonalization, Gibbs sampling, and prediction with uncertainty quantification. The model combination methodology follows [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033266) by Giuliani et al.

## Features

- **Data Management**: Load and preprocess nuclear mass data from HDF5 and CSV files
- **Orthogonalization**: Transform model predictions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Bayesian Inference**: Perform Gibbs sampling for model combination
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Generate predictions with credible intervals
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculate coverage statistics for model validation

## Installation

```bash
pip install pybmc
```

## Quick Start
