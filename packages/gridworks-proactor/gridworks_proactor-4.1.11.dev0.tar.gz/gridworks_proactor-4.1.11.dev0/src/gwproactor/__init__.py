"""This packages provides infrastructure for running a proactor on top of asyncio with support multiple MQTT clients
and and sub-objects which support their own threads for synchronous operations.

This packages is not GridWorks-aware (except that it links actors with multiple mqtt clients). This separation between
communication / action infrastructure and GridWorks semantics is intended to allow the latter to be more focussed.
