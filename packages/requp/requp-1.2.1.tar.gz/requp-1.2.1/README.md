- ✅ **Smart Version Handling**: Supports all version specifiers (>=, <, ~, etc.)
- ✅ **Package Extras**: Correctly handles packages with extras (e.g., `Flask[async]`)
- ✅ **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them
- ✅ **Enhanced Dry Run**: Shows complete updated requirements.txt content
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Warns about packages not found in pip freeze
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## 🚀 Installation

### Homebrew (macOS) - Recommended
```bash
brew install abozaralizadeh/brew/pipup
```

### PyPI
```bash
pip install requp
```

**Note**: After installation, you can use either `pipup` or `requp` commands - they work identically!

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abozaralizadeh/pipup.git
cd pipup
pip install -e .
```

### Direct Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/abozaralizadeh/pipup.git
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
pipup                                    # Update requirements.txt (default)
# or
requp                                    # Update requirements.txt (default)
```

**Note**: All commands use `requirements.txt` as the default file when no filename is specified.

### Dry Run (Preview Changes)
```bash
pipup --dry-run                          # Preview changes to requirements.txt
# or
requp --dry-run                          # Preview changes to requirements.txt
```

### Upgrade to Latest Versions
```bash
pipup -U                                 # Update to latest versions from PyPI
pipup -U --dry-run                       # Preview latest version updates
pipup requirements-dev.txt -U            # Update specific file to latest
# or use requp instead of pipup
```

### Update Different Requirements Files
```bash
pipup requirements-dev.txt               # Update specific file
pipup requirements-prod.txt              # Update specific file
pipup requirements-test.txt              # Update specific file
# or use requp instead of pipup
```

### Package Management Commands
```bash
pipup remove --all                    # Remove all packages except pipup
pipup remove                          # Remove packages from requirements.txt (default)
pipup remove requirements.txt         # Remove packages from specific file
pipup free                            # Remove version constraints from requirements.txt (default)
pipup free requirements.txt           # Remove version constraints from specific file
# or use requp instead of pipup
```

### Get Help
```bash
pipup --help
pipup --version
# or
requp --help
requp --version
```

## 🎛️ Skip Conventions

Pipup supports special comment conventions to control which packages get updated:

### Skip Single Package
```txt
# This package should not be updated
#skip-pipup
requests==2.31.0

# Or use the requp alias
#skip-requp
Flask>=2.0.0
```

### Skip All Remaining Packages
```txt
# Everything below this line should be ignored
#stop-pipup
pydantic==1.10.15
azure-storage-blob==12.19.1
# This comment will also be preserved
```

### Supported Conventions
- `#skip-pipup` or `#skip-requp` - Skip the next package line
- `#stop-pipup` or `#stop-requp` - Skip all remaining lines

## 🔄 Upgrade Mode

The `-U` or `--upgrade` flag updates packages to their latest versions from PyPI instead of using the versions from `pip freeze`. This is useful when you want to:

- **Update to latest**: Get the newest versions of all packages
- **Stay current**: Keep your dependencies up-to-date
- **Test compatibility**: Check if your code works with latest versions

**Note**: Skip and stop conventions work the same way in upgrade mode, giving you fine-grained control over which packages get updated.

## 🗑️ Package Management Commands

Pipup now includes powerful package management commands for cleaning up your virtual environment:

### Remove All Packages
```bash
pipup remove --all
```
Removes all packages from the virtual environment except pipup itself. This is useful for:
- **Clean slate**: Starting fresh with a clean environment
- **Environment reset**: Removing all dependencies before reinstalling
- **Testing**: Ensuring clean test environments

### Remove Specific Packages
```bash
pipup remove                          # Remove packages from requirements.txt (default)
pipup remove requirements-dev.txt     # Remove packages from specific file
pipup remove requirements-prod.txt    # Remove packages from specific file
```
Removes only the packages listed in the specified requirements file. This is useful for:
- **Selective cleanup**: Remove only specific project dependencies
- **Environment isolation**: Clean up project-specific packages
- **Dependency management**: Remove packages from specific requirement files

### Free Version Constraints
```bash
pipup free                            # Remove version constraints from requirements.txt (default)
pipup free requirements-dev.txt       # Remove version constraints from specific file
pipup free requirements-prod.txt      # Remove version constraints from specific file
```
Removes all version constraints from the requirements file, keeping only package names. This is useful for:
- **Flexible versions**: Allow pip to choose compatible versions
- **Development**: Remove strict version pinning during development
- **Compatibility testing**: Test with different version combinations

**Examples:**
```txt
# Before
requests==2.28.1
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas[dev]==1.5.0
flask>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

# After pipup free
requests
numpy
pandas[dev]
flask
```

## 📋 Examples

### Before Running Pipup
```txt
requests
Flask>=2.0.0
langchain
pydantic>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
# This is a comment
azure-storage-blob
Flask[async]
duckduckgo-search
```

### After Running Pipup
```txt
requests==2.32.4
Flask==3.1.1
langchain==0.3.27
pydantic==2.11.7
# This is a comment
azure-storage-blob==12.26.0
Flask[async]==3.1.1
duckduckgo-search
```

### Dry Run Output
```bash
$ pipup --dry-run
Running pip freeze...
Found 246 installed packages
Dry run: Updating test_requirements.txt...
Warning: flask not found in pip freeze, keeping original specification
Warning: duckduckgo-search not found in pip freeze, keeping original specification

Dry run: Would update 4 packages
Packages not found in pip freeze: flask, duckduckgo-search

Updated requirements.txt content:
--------------------------------------------------
requests==2.31.0
Flask>=2.0.0
langchain==0.0.329
pydantic==1.10.15
# This is a comment
azure-storage-blob==12.19.1
Flask[async]
duckduckgo-search
--------------------------------------------------
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Runs pip freeze** to get all installed packages with exact versions
2. **Parses requirements.txt** line by line, preserving formatting and comments
3. **Matches packages** by name (case-insensitive) and handles extras
4. **Updates version specifiers** to exact versions (==) from pip freeze
5. **Preserves everything else** (comments, empty lines, package order, warnings)

## 📦 Supported Version Specifiers

Pipup handles all standard pip version specifiers:

| Specifier | Example | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| No version | `requests` | `requests==2.32.4` |
| Exact version | `requests==1.0.0` | `requests==2.32.4` |
| Minimum version | `requests>=1.0.0` | `requests==2.32.4` |
| Maximum version | `requests<3.0.0` | `requests==2.32.4` |
| Version range | `requests>=1.0.0,<3.0.0` | `requests==2.32.4` |
| Compatible release | `requests~=1.0.0` | `requests==2.32.4` |
| Exclusion | `requests!=1.0.0` | `requests==2.32.4` |

## 🎯 Package Extras Support

Pipup correctly handles packages with extras:

```txt
# Before
Flask[async]
requests[security]
django[postgresql]

# After
Flask[async]==3.1.1
requests[security]==2.32.4
django[postgresql]==4.2.7
```

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- **Missing requirements.txt**: Exits with clear error message
- **Package not found**: Warns and keeps original specification
- **pip not found**: Exits with helpful error message
- **Invalid requirements.txt**: Preserves malformed lines as-is
- **Permission errors**: Clear error messages for file access issues
