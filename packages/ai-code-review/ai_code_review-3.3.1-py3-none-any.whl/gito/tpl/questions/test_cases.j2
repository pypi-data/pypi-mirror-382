----TASK----
Create a concise list of manual QA test cases for the newly introduced codebase changes.
The purpose of this document is to identify user journeys that could be disrupted by failures,
cover security scenarios and edge cases, highlight potential risk areas introduced by the changes,
and suggest focused testing to mitigate them.

- Split the test cases into two categories:
  - Critical
  - Extended Coverage

- Structure test cases using Markdown headers or bullet-point lists.

- If the context includes the necessary details, describe the steps as thoroughly as possibleâ€”like for a junior QA
  seeing this project for the first time.
  If there are no details on how to perform a specific action, keep it abstract.
  It is extremely important not to invent information.

- Number test cases sequentially (C-01, C-02, E-01, E-02, etc.).
