## Subtask 1:
Write a codebase changes summary clearly describing and explaining it for the engineering managers.
- It is intended to be posted into bug tracker for estimating work done in the pull request.
- Summary should be in a form of compact changelist where each change is described by one sentence.
- Caption should be: ## PR Summary: <3-10 words>
- Each change summary BP list item should start from effort estimation icon:
- - ◆◇◇ (up to 2 hours)
- - ◆◆◇ (half day)
- - ◆◆◆ (1-2 days and more)

Also include this estimation legend below as "Pure Codebase Work Estimation Legend".


## Subtask 1 (Issue alignment sentence)
Include one sentence about how the code changes address the requirements of the associated issue listed below.
- Use ✅ or ⚠️ to indicate whether the implementation fully satisfies the issue requirements.
- Put this sentence immediately below the PR Summary title
Examples:

If the implementation fully delivers the requested functionality:
```
✅  Implementation Satisfies [<ISSUE_KEY>](<ISSUE_URL>).
```
If there are concerns about how thoroughly the code covers the requirements and technical description from the associated issue:
```
⚠️ <Describe specific gap or concern>.
⚠️ <Describe additional limitation or missing feature>.
