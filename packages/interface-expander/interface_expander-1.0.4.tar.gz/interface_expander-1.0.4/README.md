# USB Interface Expander

**`interface-expander`** is a lightweight Python library that allows you to communicate with **USB Interface Expander** devices.  
It provides a simple API for interacting with IÂ²C peripherals and controlling analog outputs (Â±12 V, 2-channels) directly from Python.

## ðŸ§© Features

- **USB â†’ IÂ²C bridge** â€” communicate with IÂ²C sensors and devices from your PC  
- **USB â†’ Â±12 V DAC output** â€” set precise analog voltages from Python  
- **Cross-platform** â€” works on Windows, macOS, and Linux   
- **Plug-and-play** â€” automatically detects connected Interface Expander devices (no additional drivers needed)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites
To use this python library, you will need one of the following two **USB Interface Expander** devices:

- ðŸ”— [**USB to IÂ²C Converter with GUI**](https://www.tindie.com/products/almcoding/usb-to-i2c-converter-with-gui/)  

- ðŸ”— [**USB to Â±12V DAC Module, 16-bit, 2-Channel Analog**](https://www.tindie.com/products/almcoding/usb-to-12v-dac-module-16-bit-2-channel-analog/)
