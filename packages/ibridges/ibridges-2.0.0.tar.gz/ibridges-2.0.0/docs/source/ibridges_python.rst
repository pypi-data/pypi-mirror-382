iBridges with Python
====================

This section is for users that want to use Python to connect to their iRODS server and perform
data manipulations. The Python API (Application Programming Interface) is the most feature complete
part of iBridges and it is also the most flexible, since users can manipulate the underlying
data structures to be able to use all the features of the underlying `python-irodsclient <https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient>`__
library. Alternatively, users can use the :doc:`Command Line Interface <cli>` or the `Graphical User Interface <https://github.com/chStaiger/iBridges-Gui>`__.
