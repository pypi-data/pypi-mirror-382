    The resulting `MergedDuckDBExec` nodes behave like a boundary between the
    outer execution engine and DuckDB. During execution:

    - The *outer engine* only sees the flattened `children`, which connect this
      merged subtree to the rest of the plan.
    - Inside the merged node, the `merge_root` subtree is traversed bottom-up
      to register SQL views for every original operator. This allows DuckDB's
      planner to perform its own fusion optimizations across what were
      previously separate plan nodes.
