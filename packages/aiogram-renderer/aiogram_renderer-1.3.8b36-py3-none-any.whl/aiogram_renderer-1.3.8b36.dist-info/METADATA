              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## О проекте
Библиотека создана для того чтобы ее можно было использовать вместе с aiogram, а не вместо aiogram. Реализованы
основные текстовые и клавиатурные виджеты, чтобы ускорить и упростить создание telegram ботов.

#### Поддержка разработчика

## Функции
aiogram-renderer включает в себя:
- 100% асинхронность
- гибкую структуру, позволяющую без проблем использовать библиотеку совместно с aiogram
- поддержку как Reply так и Inline клавиатур
- удобный виджет Progress для управления загрузками
- режимы бота, доступные из разных окон
- работу с файлами
- организованную логику для управления FSM данными окон
- окна-уведомления, которые можно отправлять без использования данных в FSM
- управление видимостью виджетов через параметр show_on
- динамические наборы кнопок доступные из разных окон

## Установка
Для установки, выполните команду
```
pip install aiogram-renderer
```
## Начало
Для подключения библиотеки к проекту надо выполнить функцию configure_renderer, в
ней вам нужно передать окна, которые будут использоваться в проекте и настроить при необходимости режимы.
```python
async def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    await configure_renderer(
        dp=dp,
        # Подключаем окна
        windows=[window],
        # Задаем режимы бота (первый активный по умолчанию)
        modes=[
            BotMode(
                name="mode1",
                values=["off 🟥⬜️  Режим 1", "on ⬜️🟩  Режим 1"],
                alert_window=alert,
            ),
            BotMode(
                name="mode2",
                values=["off 🟥⬜️  Режим 2", "on ⬜️🟩  Режим 2"],
                alert_window=alert,
                has_custom_handler=False
            )
        ]
    )

    await bot.delete_webhook(drop_pending_updates=True)
    await dp.start_polling(bot)
```

## Типы окон
Для работы можно использовать 2 типа окон:
1. Window - окно с состоянием State, данные хранятся в памяти FSM. 
Рендерятся окна с установкой стейта автоматически.
Мапятся по state, подробнее в разделе.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Тест окна"),
    Panel(
        Button(text="Кнопка", data="button"),
        Button(text="Тоже кнопка", data="button_too"),
        Mode(name="mode1"),
        width=2
    ),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)
```
2. Alert - окно-уведомление, его данные не хранятся в FSM, соответственно на alert есть ограничения по использованию некоторых виджетов (Mode, DynamicPanel)
```python
alert = Alert(
    Area(
        Bold("Тест окна", end_count=3),
        "все хорошо",
        sep_count=2
    )
```
## Отправка
Для отправки сообщений из собранных окон с виджетами, используйте функции render из встроенного аргумента renderer с mode=RenderMode.ANSWER и др. или
более быстрые answer, edit, delete_and_send, reply. Вы можете использовать chat_id, message_id или event по желанию,
по умолчанию renderer подхватывает event в хендлере.
```python
@dp.message(F.text=="/start")
async def start(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    message, window = await renderer.render(window=window, chat_id=message.chat_id, message_id=message.message_id, mode=RenderMode.EDIT)
```
> [!NOTE]
> Вы можете использовать renderer вместе с обычными методами update
```python
@dp.message(F.text=="use1")
async def use1(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    # Использование хендлера с Renderer
    message, window = await renderer.delete_and_send(window=window)

@dp.message(F.text=="use2")
async def use2(message: Message):
    # Использование встроенных методов окна для генерации исключельно клавиатуры или текста
    text = await window.gen_text(data={"username": message.from_user.username})
    await message.answer(text=text)

@dp.message(F.text=="use3")
async def use3(message: Message):
    # Использование хендлера без Renderer
    await message.answer(text="Все ок!")
```


## Хранение данных
Данные собранные через библиотеку хранятся в fsm для каждого пользователя в следующем формате:

```json
{
    "__modes__": {
      "mode1": ["off 🟥⬜️  Режим 1", "on ⬜️🟩  Режим 1"],
      "mode2": ["off 🟥⬜️  Режим 2", "on ⬜️🟩  Режим 2"]
    },
    "__dpanels__": {
      "test_dp": {
        "page": 2,
        "text": ["1","2","3"],
        "data": ["d1","d2","d3"]
      }
    },
    "__windows__": {
        "MainSteps.step1": {
            "username": "Коля",
            "visible": true
        },
        "MainSteps.step2": {
            "username": "Маша",
            "surname": "Сечинова",
            "visible": false
        }
    }
}
```
Все окна хранятся в порядке открытия и могут перезаписываться если указывать новые параметры data при их рендере:
```python
@dp.message(F.text=="/start")
async def start(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    await renderer.delete_and_send(window=window, data={"username": message.from_user.username})
```
> [!TIP]
> Сами поля содержат в себе данные которые вы можете подставить в окно, использовав фигурные скобки в некоторых параметрах виджетов:
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна"),
    Panel(
        Button(text="Кнопка", data="button{username}"),
        Button(text="Тоже кнопка", data="button_too"),
        Mode(name="mode1"),
        width=2
    ),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)
```
## Видимость виджетов
Для управления отображением виджетами используйте параметр show_on, значение берется из параметра data функции render и в дальнейшем хранится в памяти, учитывайте это и обновляйте параметр при необходимости.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна"),
    Panel(
        Button(text="Кнопка", data="button{username}", show_on="is_admin"),
        Button(text="Тоже кнопка", data="button_too", show_on="is_admin"),
        Mode(name="mode1"),
        width=2
    ),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)

@dp.message(F.text=="/start")
async def start(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    await renderer.delete_and_send(window=window, data={"is_admin": True})
```
## Режимы
Частенько требовалась кнопка которая бы обновляла и хранила свое активное состояние в разных сообщениях. Режимы позволяют реализовать это, укажите их в configure_renderer
и потом передавайте в окна через Mode, ReplyMode виджеты. У каждого режима есть alert_window, это нужно чтобы работал системный хендлер ReplyMode, также вы можете указать has_custom_handler и настроить свою хендлер для обработки апдейта режима.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна"),
    ReplyPanel(
        ReplyButton(text="Кнопка", data="button{username}"),
        ReplyButton(text="Тоже кнопка", data="button_too", show_on="is_admin"),
        ReplyMode(name="mode2"),
        width=2
    ),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)

async def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    await configure_renderer(
        dp=dp,
        # Подключаем окна
        windows=[window],
        # Задаем режимы бота (первый активный по умолчанию)
        modes=[
            BotMode(
                name="mode1",
                values=["off 🟥⬜️  Режим 1", "on ⬜️🟩  Режим 1"],
            ),
            BotMode(
                name="mode2",
                values=["Админ", "Юзер", "Продавец"],
                alert_window=alert,
                has_custom_handler=True
            )
        ]
    )

    await bot.delete_webhook(drop_pending_updates=True)
    await dp.start_polling(bot)

@dp.message(IsMode("mode2"))
async def update_mode(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    # Получаем режим с помощью функции get_mode_by_value (также есть get_mode_by_name)
    mode = await renderer.bot_modes.get_mode_by_value(value=message.text)
    # Обновляем режим
    await renderer.bot_modes.update_mode(mode=mode.name)
    # Обновляем окно
    await renderer.edit(window=MenuStates.step1)
```
## Прогресс бар
Для управления полосой загрузки используйте виджет Progress и функцию update_progress, задайте нужный интервал обновления.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна", end_count=2),
    Progress(name="test_pr")
    Panel(
        Button(text="Кнопка", data="button{username}"),
        Button(text="Тоже кнопка", data="button_too", show_on="is_admin"),
        Mode(name="mode1"),
        width=2
    ),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)

@dp.message(F.text=="/start")
async def start(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    data = {"username": message,from_user.username, "test_pr": 0}
    
    # Сначала будет установлен процент 0
    pr_message, window = await renderer.answer(window=MenuStates.step1, data=data)
    
    for i in range(99):
        await renderer.update_progress(window=MenuStates.step1, event=pr_message, interval=0.3,
                                       name="test_pr", percent=i, data=data)
        await sleep(0.3)
```
## Динамические наборы
Для отображения кнопок со своими данными используется виджет DynamicPanel. Нужно указать text, data и первую активную
страницу, данные сохранятся в FSM и будут доступны для всех окон.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна", end_count=2),
    DynamicPanel(name="dpanel", hide_number_pages=True),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)

@dp.message(F.text=="/start")
async def start(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    data = {
        "dpanel": {
            "page": 2,
            "text": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
            "data": ["d1", "d2", "d3", "d4", "d5"]
        },
    }
    await renderer.answer(window=MenuStates.step1, data=data)

@dp.callback_query(F.data.startswith("d"))
async def dpanel_opt(callback: CallbackQuery, renderer: Renderer):
    # Тут ваши действия для обработки кнопок из DynamicPanel
    pass
```
## Файлы
Для работы с файлами реализовано 2 виджета, первый это виджет File и его дочерние Photo, Video, Audio. В нем мы указываем путь к файлу и его название.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна", end_count=2),
    Audio(file_name="audio.mp3", path="audio.mp3"),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)
```
Второй это FileBytes, он используется для передачи файла в байтах, данные не хранятся в памяти и отображаются
только тогда когда вы передаете параметр file_bytes в функции render.
```python
window = Window(
    Text("Привет {username}, Тест окна", end_count=2),
    AudioBytes(file_name="audio.mp3", bytes_name="bytes_a"),
    state=MainSteps.step1
)

@dp.message(F.text=="/start")
async def start(message: Message, renderer: Renderer):
    async with aiofiles.open(file="audio.mp3", mode="rb") as f:
        await renderer.answer(window=MenuStates.step1, file_bytes={"bytes_a": await f.read()})
```
Медиа группа имеет специфичную логику работы, так что пока она в разработке, нужно понять как ее правильно добавить в экосистему библиотеки.

## Будущее проекта

В документации указаны не все виджеты, с остальными предлагаю ознакомиться самостоятельно 😉
По мере поддержки или при необходимости в работе буду добавлять новые виджеты и совершенствовать библиотеку, кому интересно. Так в планах MediaGroup, ReplyDynamicPanel, поддержка виджетов в Alert,
виджет Calendar и поддержка доп. полей для кнопок, которые задаются в aiogram. Также возможно сделаю виджет DynamicMediaGroup. Все по мере возможностей, спасибо что прочитали.
