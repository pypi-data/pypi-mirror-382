    This is the evaluation routine for the Filter class.

    Implements a DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) interpretter. Predicates in the same
    list are joined with an AND (*all()*) and predicates in adjacent lists are joined
    with an OR (*any()*). This allows for non-trivial filters to be written with just
    _tuples_ and _lists_.

    is the value looked up from the record, the `op` is the operator and the `value`

        A class to supporting filtering data.

        Parameters:
            filters: list of tuples
                Each tuple has format: (`key`, `op`, `value`). When run the
                filter will extract the `key` field from the dictionary and
                compare to the `value` using the operator `op`. Multiple
                filters are treated as AND, lists of ANDs are treated as ORs.
                The supported `op` values are: `=` or `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`,
                `<=`, `>=`, `in`, `!in` (not in), `contains`, `!contains`
                (does not contain) and `like`. If the `op` is `in` or `!in`,
                the `value` must be a collection such as a _list_, a _set_
                or a _tuple_.
                `like` performs similar to the SQL operator, `%` is a
                multi-character wildcard and `_` is a single character
                wildcard.

        Examples:
            filters = Filters([('name', '==', 'john')])
            filters = Filters([('name', '!=', 'john'),('name', '!=', 'tom')])
