# ADRI Architecture Guide

*Simple, clear explanations of how ADRI works and why each piece matters*

## ADRI in 30 Seconds

**The Problem:** AI agents break when you feed them bad data. A customer record with `age: -5` or `email: "not-an-email"` crashes your expensive AI calls.

**The Solution:** One decorator that checks data quality before your function runs.

**The Result:** Prevent 80% of production AI failures with zero configuration.

```python
@adri_protected  # This line prevents most AI agent failures
def your_agent_function(data):
    return expensive_ai_call(data)  # Now protected from bad data
```

## How ADRI Works (The Flow)

Think of ADRI as a **quality bouncer** for your AI functions:

```
1. Data arrives → 2. ADRI checks → 3. Decision → 4. Your function
   {"age": -5}     "Is this OK?"    "NO! Block!"   (Never runs)

   {"age": 25}     "Is this OK?"    "YES! Allow"   ✅ Runs safely
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **You call your function** with data
2. **ADRI intercepts** before your code runs
3. **ADRI asks**: "Is this data good enough for AI?"
4. **ADRI checks** 5 quality dimensions:
   - ✅ **Valid** - Correct formats (real emails, valid dates)
   - ✅ **Complete** - No missing required fields
   - ✅ **Consistent** - Same format across records
   - ✅ **Fresh** - Recent enough for your needs
   - ✅ **Realistic** - Values make sense (age 0-120, not -5)
5. **ADRI decides**:
   - Score ≥ 75/100 → **ALLOW** (your function runs)
   - Score < 75/100 → **BLOCK** (prevents failure)
6. **ADRI logs** every decision for compliance

## What's Inside ADRI (The Complete Architecture)

### **🛡️ Guard Decorator (The Bouncer)**
*File: `src/adri/decorator.py`* | **Coverage: 78.79%** ✅ | **Multi-Dimensional Score: 89.8%** ✅

**What it does:** The `@adri_protected` decorator that wraps your functions with explicit, transparent configuration.

**Why it exists:** Single entry point that makes any Python function safe from bad data with clear, visible parameters.

**Simplified API (User-Driven Design):**
- `@adri_protected()` - **Single, explicit decorator** with all configuration options visible

**Common Configuration Patterns:**
```python
# High-quality production workflow:
@adri_protected(standard="financial_data", min_score=90, on_failure="raise")

# Development/testing workflow:
@adri_protected(standard="test_data", min_score=70, on_failure="warn", verbose=True)

# Financial-grade protection:
@adri_protected(
    standard="banking_data",
    min_score=95,
    dimensions={"validity": 19, "completeness": 19, "consistency": 18},
    on_failure="raise"
)
```

**Design Philosophy:** Explicit over implicit - all protection parameters are clearly visible with no "magic" behavior.

**How it works:** Intercepts function calls, triggers assessment, enforces protection decisions with full transparency.

### **🔍 Validator Engine (The Quality Inspector)**
*Module: `src/adri/validator/`* | **Coverage: 87.25%** ✅ | **Multi-Dimensional Score: 92%+** ✅

**Components:**
- `engine.py` - ValidationEngine, DataQualityAssessor, AssessmentResult classes
- `rules.py` - Field-level validation logic (validate_field, check_field_type, etc.)
- `loaders.py` - Data loading utilities (load_csv, load_json, load_parquet)

**What it does:** Scores your data from 0-100 across 5 quality dimensions.

**Why it exists:** Objective measurement of whether data is "good enough" for AI.

**Advanced Features:**
- **Multi-format Data Loading** - CSV, JSON, Parquet with automatic type detection
- **Comprehensive Validation Rules** - Field-level validation with configurable constraints
- **Assessment Result Objects** - Detailed scoring with dimension breakdowns and failure reporting
- **Integration Testing** - Real-world data assessment scenarios with edge case handling

**How it works:**
- Loads data from multiple formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Runs validation rules on your data
- Calculates scores for validity, completeness, consistency, freshness, plausibility
- Returns comprehensive assessment results with dimension breakdown
- Provides detailed failure analysis and quality improvement recommendations

---

### **🛠️ Protection Modes (The Decision Makers)**
*File: `src/adri/guard/modes.py`* | **Coverage: 95.00%** ✅ | **Multi-Dimensional Score: 95%+** ✅

**What it does:** Decides whether to allow or block function execution using configurable protection modes.

**Why it exists:** Different scenarios need different protection strategies (strict vs permissive).

**Protection Modes:**
- **FailFastMode** - Immediately stops execution on quality failure (production)
- **SelectiveMode** - Logs warnings but continues execution (balanced)
- **WarnOnlyMode** - Shows warnings but never blocks (development/monitoring)

**Advanced Features:**
- **DataProtectionEngine** - Complete protection orchestration with real-world integration
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks and detailed error reporting
- **Configuration Management** - Flexible settings with environment-specific defaults
- **Multi-dimensional Assessment** - Validity, completeness, consistency scoring integration

**How it works:**
- Modern OOP design with abstract ProtectionMode base class
- Configurable DataProtectionEngine with pluggable modes
- Takes assessment scores and returns ALLOW/BLOCK decisions
- Comprehensive edge case handling and error recovery

### **📋 Standards System (The Rulebook)**
*Module: `src/adri/standards/`* | **Coverage: 27.69%** ⚠️

**Components:**
- `parser.py` - StandardsParser for YAML loading and validation
- `schema.yaml` - Meta-schema defining valid standard structure

**What it does:** Loads and manages data quality rules (standards) from YAML files.

**Why it exists:** Different data types need different rules. Customer data ≠ financial data.

**How it works:**
- Ships with built-in audit log standards
- Loads custom standards from YAML files with caching
- Validates standard structure against meta-schema
- Supports offline-first operation for enterprise environments

---

### **🧠 Analysis Engine (The Data Scientist)**
*Module: `src/adri/analysis/`* | **Coverage: ~18%** ⚠️

**Components:**
- `data_profiler.py` - DataProfiler for analyzing data patterns and structure
- `standard_generator.py` - StandardGenerator for creating YAML standards from analysis
- `type_inference.py` - TypeInference for inferring data types and validation rules

**What it does:** Analyzes your data patterns and creates quality standards automatically.

**Why it exists:** Every dataset is unique. ADRI learns what "good" looks like for your data.

**How it works:**
- Profiles incoming data structure, patterns, and quality characteristics
- Infers appropriate data types and validation constraints
- Generates complete YAML standards with field requirements and dimension thresholds
- Provides recommendations for data quality improvement

---

### **⚙️ Configuration System (The Settings)**
