# Coin-Calculator and currency converter
A calculator! How fun! Intended for people like me who don't want to use their brains. Use it to calculate how many coins ya got! Also convert currencies with the currency converter!

## Demo:
To demo the app, you can either download the source code and the required dependency, and run it yourself, or, I have made a short video demom-ing the app if you would rather not download random files onto your device:


## Features:
 - Simple calculator, able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
 - Currency converter that can convert between USD, CAD and EUR. (more may be added soon)
 - History; shows the last 5 calculations you have done, whether it was done with the calculator or the converter.
 - Extended history; a button that opens a new window showing the last 20 calculations you have done, rather than the last 5.
 - Dark and light modes.

## Dependencies:
FreeSimpleGUI, https://github.com/spyoungtech/FreeSimpleGUI

## Disclaimer!!
The converter may not be 100% accurate! The conversion rates are based off of what the data from exchange-rates.org said at the time of coding the application, (2025/10/04). Use this ONLY to get a general gist of what different currencies are like. if you need something more accurate, a web search will serve you better :)
