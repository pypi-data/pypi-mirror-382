number density wrong

A complex **example with solvent** based on an example from
`MDAnalysis Trajectory transformations
<https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/trajectory_transformations.html#>`_
For MD simulation in a box of solvent we have to take care that the objects of interest, here a protein,
is not placed at the border of the simulation box.


 - The first issue is here that the trajectory contains dummy atoms for the solvent center of mass
   additional to the solvent atoms. We have to remove these.
 - The second issue is the position of the protein. The transformation shifts coordinates to have the protein
   in the box and a surrounding box full of solvent with not broken solvent molecules.
 - Then we compare scattering with and without explicit solvent.
