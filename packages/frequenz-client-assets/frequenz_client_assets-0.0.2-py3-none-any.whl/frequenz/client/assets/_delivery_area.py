    """The identification code types used in the energy market.

    CodeType specifies the type of identification code used for uniquely
    identifying various entities such as delivery areas, market participants,
    and grid components within the energy market.

    This enumeration aims to
    offer compatibility across different jurisdictional standards.

    Note: Understanding Code Types
        Different regions or countries may have their own standards for uniquely
        identifying various entities within the energy market. For example, in
        Europe, the Energy Identification Code (EIC) is commonly used for this
        purpose.

    Note: Extensibility
        New code types can be added to this enum to accommodate additional regional
        standards, enhancing the API's adaptability.

    Danger: Validation Required
        The chosen code type should correspond correctly with the `code` field in
        the relevant message objects, such as `DeliveryArea` or `Counterparty`.
        Failure to match the code type with the correct code could lead to
        processing errors.
