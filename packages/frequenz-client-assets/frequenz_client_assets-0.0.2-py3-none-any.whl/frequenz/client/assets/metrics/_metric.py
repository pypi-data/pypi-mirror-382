    Note: AC energy metrics information
        - This energy metric is reported directly from the component, and not a
          result of aggregations in our systems. If a component does not have this
          metric, this field cannot be populated.

        - Components that provide energy metrics reset this metric from time to
          time. This behaviour is specific to each component model. E.g., some
          components reset it on UTC 00:00:00.

          period,and therefore can be inconsistent.
