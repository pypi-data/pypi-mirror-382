    A microgrid is a localized grouping of electricity generation, energy storage, and
    loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid.

    Each microgrid has a unique identifier and is associated with an enterprise account.

    A key feature is that it has a physical location and is situated in a delivery area.

    Note: Key Concepts
        - Physical Location: Geographical coordinates specify the exact physical
          location of the microgrid.
        - Delivery Area: Each microgrid is part of a broader delivery area, which is
          crucial for energy trading and compliance.
